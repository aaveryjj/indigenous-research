wa1,"For Us, By Us: Indigenous Land-based Science Learning",Marissa Spang,2017,Thesis,Education,Everyday Indigeneity; Indigenous Science; Indigenous Youth; Land-based; Science Learning; STEM Learning; Educational psychology,University of Washington,1003324891,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/items/c2783ce3-a9b6-41e0-b676-6645bebd7713,Record,47.65791637,-122.3068518,Text,"Indigenous students and families who are learning ‘science’ or ‘STEM’ in settler societies (e.g. the United States and Canada) are forced to engage in formal and informal science learning settings that are predominantly founded upon a settler, Western science that not only positions its science as “real” or “The” science, but also positions Indigenous students’ epistemologies and ontologies as not “real knowing” or relevant to “real science.” This erasure paradigm in science learning settings is a reflection of the large settler-colonial system that seeks to erase and supplant Indigeneity. This must shift if Indigenous student STEM trajectories are to not only improve, but also improve in ways that are accountable to and grounded in their Indigenous value systems, original relations and collective continuances. To build towards this, the current work re-frames and Indigenizes a prominent western human learning theory, i.e. Learning in Informal and Formal Environments (LIFE), to develop an Indigenous theory/story to LIFE, referred to as I-LIFE. Given I-LIFE is a theory/story about Indigenous life-long, life-deep, and life–wide learning, it is responsible for being put into Indigenous practice, i.e. lived directly in land and relations to be made fully meaningful. Thus, the second section of the current work outlines how I-LIFE unfolded in the form of Indigenous Land-based Science Learning (ILBSL) directly in/with the Cheyenne territory, by Cheyenne people and according to Cheyenne ontology, epistemology, axiology and collective continuance. To achieve this, ILBSL apprenticed and socialized Native students as good ancestors/bio-cultural restoration scientists to story, practice, adapt and synthesize Western science with/according to Cheyenne Science and values (including Sweet Medicine’s Adaptation Theory) through an ‘unceded time’ paradigm. This reciprocal relationing of story and practice, i.e. I-LIFE and ILBSL, respectively, is a promising strategy in increasing Native student learning, retention and trajectories in STEM by Indigenous peoples (i.e. according to Indigenous ontologies and axiologies), for Indigenous peoples (i.e. collective continuance). Together, I-LIFE and ILBSL achieved a pivotal Indigenous learning paradigm that is essential to the resurgence and reclaiming of Indigenous peoples’ sovereign knowledges, ontologies, axiologies and collective continuances. Thus, the current work has implications for other Indigenous communities seeking to reclaim their children’s learning through ILBSL so as continue their trajectories towards just and viable Indigenous futurities on Indigenous peoples’ terms."

Such violations can be represented by, and better understood, through an exploration of the behavioral traits of the Algonquian figure of the Windigo, or wétiko, even when the text in question would not be classified as horror. In the Indigenous works of fiction that this dissertation explores, villainy is depicted as behavior that destroys balance, and disrupts the ability for life to reproduce itself without human mediation or technological intervention. In this dissertation, I develop and apply “Windigo Theory”: an Indigenous literary approach to reading Indigenous fiction, especially intended to aid recognition and comprehension of cultural critiques represented by the fearsome figures. I draw especially from four quarters: Jack D. Forbes’ concept of colonialism as a manifestation of wétiko psychosis; ethnographical works that feature fearsome figures from the stories of North American tribal peoples; Indigenous philosophical worldviews; and the figures in contemporary Native American novels that also serve as the objects of analysis. To show how fearsome figures disrupt Indigenous values and relationships, there is emphasis on what the fearsome figures do, as opposed to what fearsome figures are. In other words, this approach is geared to follow motion and relationships, rather than to define or circumscribe. As part of this work, I also explore the radical reinscription of generic conventions by Native authors, and discuss how some features of contemporary Indigenous fiction are extensions of “traditional” pre-contact narratives."

This dissertation examines the ways winyan okodakiciye work to address the community impacts of settler colonialism, colonial patriarchy, violence and historical oppression by nourishing resilience and providing community-care through Indigenous resurgence. The community care provided by winyan okodakiciye rooted in a deep relationality linking resilience to the powerful knowledge systems cradled within ceremony, language, cultural systems & structures. Following the works of Indigenous scholars of Glen Coulthard and Leanne Betasamosake, this can be recognized as a place-based lifeway standing upon a historical grounding of Indigenous systems and reveals living, breathing precolonial formation contemporarily driven by concepts and acts of rematriation, resistance, and resurgence."

Specifically, I bring place-based Anishinaabe knowledge and experiences into dialogue with food sovereignty scholarship, Indigenous studies and feminist geographies to examine how Indigenous foodways have and continue to be impacted by colonial-capitalist structures of violence, including historical legacies of genocidal practices of assimilation and contemporary colonialism reproduced through industry-sponsored forms of state-making, development and resource exploitation. Subsequently, I examine how Anishinaabe people embody self-determination through a balance of anti-colonial resistance and a resurgent politics. I argue that a resurgent politics is founded on the renewal of responsibilities to and a decolonial love for land, including the nexus of cultural traditions that make up land-based food practices such as language, storytelling and ceremonial protocols. Namely, everyday acts of resurgent decolonial love entail the rebuilding of intimate and spiritual relationships with family and land, the reclamation of ancestral territories and the re-envisioning, experimentation and embodiment of alternative political economies and governance structures. For Anishinaabe people, this resurgent decolonial love is founded in their ancestral law of mino bimaadiziwin or “living the good life”."

Many Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations maintain that their priorities, interests, and self-determination are undermined and excluded from current sea otter management. This thesis examines resurgence efforts by Nuu-chah-nulth Nations to re-establish ancestral governance through the case study of sea otter management on Vancouver Island. Through a critical synthesis of management reports and interviews with Indigenous and non-Indigenous actors, I consider past, present, and future plans for sea otter management on Vancouver Island through a feminist standpoint analysis. Findings suggest that structural inequities, divergent normative and material priorities, and ontological differences animate a divide between Nuu-chah-nulth and Canadian state governing bodies where it comes to sea otter management practices. Contemporary sea otter governance regimes in Canada are reproducing the unequal power relations of colonialism, to the detriment of social, environmental, legal considerations. I argue that Indigenous resurgence in sea otter management is an enactment of Nuu-chah-nulth food sovereignty, grounded in relationships of reciprocity between all non-humans and Nuu-chah-nulth Nations, and works towards revitalizing ancestral connections with the environment. Therefore, I identify a need to transform the current management system to one rooted in Nuu-chah-nulth knowledge, values, and leadership; such a governance structure would in turn be well-positioned to collaborate with non-Indigenous entities in a system that does not undermine these considerations."

To effectively center Indigenous knowledge next to and within the One Health approach, which is historically based in Western science, the gaps and overlaps between Indigenous science, specifically Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), and One Health must be explored. By encouraging the Indigenous method of Two-Eyed Seeing through collaboration between Indigenous and Western scientists, One Health must shift its framework to uphold Indigenous values. The objective of this project is to identify values in Indigenous science that are missing or underrepresented in Western science, and then collaboratively ideate actions that Western scientists can take as allies to center and support Indigenous sciences, models, and language so that Indigenous knowledge is elevated.From January to March 2023, the study team conducted semi-structured interviews with Indigenous scientists and knowledge keepers via Zoom video calls. Indigenous participants in the continental United States and Hawaiian Islands were recruited through Indigenous academic listservs, direct outreach to individuals interested in the project, and referrals from Indigenous leaders who had participated in a prior round of interviews in 2022. In that round of interviews, four themes emerged and called for further exploration of Indigenous perspectives on how 1) the natural world, 2) cultural heritage, 3) value expression, and 4) reflection influence worldviews and relationships to animals and other beings in the environment. These ideas were reframed into questions asked in a subsequent round of interviews in 2023. Theme identification methods were used to highlight recurrent and key ideas throughout the interviews. Participants noted gaps between their Indigenous worldviews and the One Health model, particularly relating to contrast with Western culture, holistic expression, power in action, identity and belonging, maintaining community and cultural practices, and sharing information/education. It was also noted that One Health must do more than uplift Indigenous values to support Indigenous scientists, such as collaborating with Traditional Ecological Knowledge keepers and encouraging practices that are inclusive and validating of other knowledge systems."

Within the Arctic, Indigenous communities are already contributing knowledge, labor, resources, and time to research, management, and conservation governance. This dissertation research examines the contributions of Indigenous knowledge and communities to biodiversity conservation in the Arctic in three areas, (1) how the evolution of conservation planning and knowledge co-production facilitates the ability of Indigenous communities to contribute to current research and conservation efforts, (2) to what extent Indigenous communities use lands, waters, and species within Arctic protected areas and to what extent they are invited to engage in management efforts, and (3) how forwarding a new framework for co-productive conservation supports partnerships with Indigenous communities, knowledge, and governance can aid in the development of ethically, conscious, culturally-relevant, and fully knowledge-based conservation efforts. Results show that Indigenous communities are critical partners in conservation, bring valuable knowledge and information to the creation of shared evidence bases, and are prepared to lead new and innovative conservation efforts when there are opportunities to support both subsistence and conservation targets and goals."

For the last couple of decades, there has been a great expansion of scholarship in the area of Latina/o education. As the field has proliferated, studies focusing on the variation within Latina/o populations have also emerged, including variation based on different countries of origin (e.g., Darder & Torres, 2014; Suárez-Orozco, 1987) and gender (e.g., Ginorio & Huston, 2001; Hondagneu-Sotelo, 2003). One highly significant yet under-investigated source of variation within the Latina/o population are indigenous immigrants from Latin America (Barajas & Ruiz, 2012). This group has been routinely silenced in their countries of origin and subsumed within the study of Latina/os in the U.S. (e.g., Stephen, 2007; Urrieta, 2013). While their identities may be collapsed, their struggles are unique and persist. Because of the systematic ways indigenous populations have been rendered invisible, I use a “coloniality of power lens” (Dussel, 1995; Lugones, 2010; Maldonado-Torres, 2007; Mignolo, 1995, 2000; Quijano, 2000) to foreground systems of oppression and power and the construction of the self and other (Corntassel, 2003, 2012; Holm, Pearson, & Chavis, 2003). In order to better understand the experiences of indigenous Latin American youth who had migrated to the U.S., I conducted a qualitative study of eight self-identifying indigenous youth from Mexico and Guatemala. Primary data for this study consists of interviews with focal youth. Other data gathered include interviews with non-self-identified indigenous Latino youth, two teachers, and one Bilingual Student Services Facilitator. Analysis of the youth’s interviews yielded three important findings. The first relates to asymmetries of power based on language. The youth described hierarchies of language, the economic opportunities afforded to Spanish speakers, and the subordinate position of indigenous languages. The second finding relates to their understanding of the discrimination indigenous peoples experienced in countries of origin and in the United States. In particular, the youth identified the use of “indio” as a racial epithet. Indio is an important vestige of coloniality as it positions indigenous peoples as inferior. The third finding elaborates on how the youth made sense of themselves and others. Participants relied on the use of indicators for making sense of the category “indigenous;” through these indicators, the youth revealed a partial understanding of their own indigeneity. I posit that the process of sense making the youth engaged in exhibited particular kinds of understanding and awareness of indigeneity, including their own and of others. This dissertation is an important contribution to the field of Latina/o education because it fills empirical and conceptual gaps. First, it shows the forms of oppression and systems of power indigenous youth understand and operate from. It also provides insights into how indigenous youth make sense of themselves and of others from their own particular lived experiences. It gives a textual space for the youth to talk about themselves in ways that are self-affirming (Smith, 1999). The second contribution relates to the historicizing of racial formations in Latina/o education. Understanding the experiences of indigenous immigrant youth requires an unpacking of racial formations tied to power inequities. The coloniality of power is one frame that historically situates the construction of a racial/economic hierarchy in the Americas. As indigenous immigrant youth continue to immigrate, the coloniality of power lens helps us understand vestiges of coloniality currently present in their contexts of departure and colonizing contexts of reception."

Furthermore, the policy process inadequately protects natural resources due to increasing political volatility, lacking value of alternative knowledge-forming processes, and inadequate engagement with local and Indigenous communities. In contrast, Indigenous communities use a different decision-making model than western entities, which generally results in a higher rate of achieving conservation objectives in natural resource management. While there is abundant literature calling for Indigenous co-management, it’s important to understand the difference and value of Indigenous decision-making. The following analysis presents multiple examples of successful Indigenous management and examines the case of aquatic species management in Western Washington, USA. The presented case study highlights that Indigenous decision-making values longstanding place-based knowledge; exercises consensus-based decision-making; and provides open and transparent communication with tribal leaders."

The majority of its population is indigenous, but the public health system available in the region is based on a decontextualized biomedical model that has been in place in Colombia since the health reform of 1993. The current health system has proved insufficient to address indigenous health realities, leading to poor access to health services, culturally incongruent hospital practices, and, ultimately, worrisome maternal-child indicators. This research focuses on understanding indigenous women’s ideas and practices of obstetric health, their decision-making processes regarding seeking hospital care, and the experiences they had when they did decide to visit the hospital (Hospital San Antonio de Mitú), focusing on the main barriers they face when attempting to access health care services. A qualitative study was conducted during June to September of 2022, which included participant observation in five communities and Hospital San Antonio de Mitú, in-depth interviews with five indigenous mothers, two indigenous healers, and the hospital manager, two focus groups with indigenous parents, and one focus group with hospital providers. Two sets of themes emerged from the data: the cultural clashes between indigenous health models and the biomedical model, and the logistical barriers that indigenous women face when trying to access the hospital."

With the tribal context at the center of this investigation, this dissertation draws on Indigenous methodological approaches and theorizes suicidal behavior by engaging both settler colonial theory and the interpersonal theory of suicide. As a way to conceptualize culturally specific mental health approaches, I present a locally designed approach to assessment that draws on Cowichan’s relational and collective formations. In the particular context of the Cowichan peoples, this project speaks back to the pressures of colonialism and the implications of the establishment of settler permanency for Indigenous futurity. Broadly, this dissertation contests individualistic models of suicide and presents the specific need to theorize Indigenous suicidal behavior from a collective orientation.

This research explores legal and theoretical applications of intellectual property rights to protect Indigenous knowledge and examines three projects initiated by the Pueblo aimed at protecting and documenting Zuni history. The cases are tribal resolutions passed by the elected body of the Pueblo, the Map Art Project, and the ""Morning Prayer"" mural in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Each case represents actions decided upon by groups within the community and are juxtaposed with YouTube videos of Hopi social dances posted by individuals without community discussions prior to the postings. The cases were analyzed using the Peoplehood Model (Holmes, Pearson and Chavez, 2005) consisting of interconnected elements (land, language, ceremonial cycle and sacred history) as analytic tools to answer the research questions of ""how is Zuni Pueblo documenting its knowledge?"" and ""how is Zuni Pueblo protecting its knowledge?"" The findings of this research include a set of tribal protections employed by several different Indigenous communities not dependent on outside or mainstream legal mechanisms, instead the protections are based on the customary laws (RaoRane, 2006) and traditions of that particular community. The findings of this research also include observations of the methods Indigenous communities employ to address breeches of protocol, whether the breech occurs in a traditional, ceremonial space or in an online environment such as in the comment pages of a YouTube video. Three general principles have emerged from the analysis of the cases and from observations of Indigenous methods of protecting ceremonial activities. These principles are infrastructure, discussion and awareness. Infrastructure refers to community based cultural advisors who can help determine culturally appropriate actions when questions arise related to potentially culturally sensitive works or actions. Community-wide discussions help communities to build upon previous and current work already done by fellow community members. Community-wide discussions help build awareness within Indigenous communities that equip and prepare community members as ambassadors for documentation and protection efforts being pursued by the community.  "

Oftentimes, the indigenous people of West Virginia are mixed with other races, including white admixtures. This study is an autoethnographical investigation into the story of my own mixed indigenous family in West Virginia. Interviews were conducted with seven of my family members from both sides of my family to provide a
narrative counterpoint about these claims. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed three major themes: Claiming Identities: State Construction and Categorization of Race, Family as Foundation for Racial Identity; and The Role of Family: Agency in Racial/Ethnic Identity Disclosure. The results are discussed using a queer phenomenological framework to illustrate indigenous identity as more nuanced and complex than assumptions based on ideologies of the state and federal government."

It performs an understudied comparison between the literary traditions of two indigenous minorities emerging from the Global South and the Fourth World. This comparison is situated within the historical context of the Spanish Conquest of Mesoamerica in 1519-1524 and the establishment of Israel in 1948 as a Jewish state. Both events have created a rupture in Mayan and Palestinian histories and geographies, respectively, thus leading to the minoritization of these indigenous peoples. I study the literature of these indigenous minorities within the context of a geography of destruction, and simultaneously, continuous dispossession and a history of ""rebirth."" The overlapping histories of colonialism and nationalism, land struggle, as well as second-class citizenship, which manifests in exclusion, discrimination, racism and oppression of Mayans and Palestinians in the states of Mexico and Israel, respectively, are the grounds for comparison. While keeping in mind their different histories of minoritization and negotiation of indigenous citizenship in a socio-political reality of internal colonialism, this study seeks to understand how the literatures of these distinct groups articulate narratives and notions of indigeneity, difference, resistance, borders, hybridity, internal colonialism and contact zones, in order to identify the elements that inform the development of indigenous minority literature as `alternative texts'. Finally, this dissertation aims at contributing to the project of New Comparative Literature and World Literature. This conversation addresses an infrastructural problem and contribute to the project of New Comparative Literature, by creating a South-South dialogue between Middle Eastern and Latin American literatures, and thus foster communication among the immense heterogeneity of the subaltern cultures of the world. This dialogue also challenges the periphery-center binary that dominates paradigms of canonization in World Literature."

Young people who experiment with or regularly use AODs are at heightened risk for experiencing AOD-related harms such as mental health issues, overconsumption, and death. Among American Indian/Alaska Native/Indigenous (hereafter, “Indigenous”) youth, contextual risk factors such as limited access to culturally relevant AOD prevention information can exacerbate their risk for AOD harms such as early onset for problematic AOD use, AOD-use disorders in adulthood, infection of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), unresolved issues of trauma, and related experiences of inter-personal violence. An effective approach to reduce AOD-related harm among youth is harm reduction. Youth-specific harm reduction studies have shown significant effects in reducing AOD use and related harms, as well as increasing knowledge and awareness. However, there is a dearth of empirical literature on the development, acceptability, and measurement of culturally relevant, theoretically grounded harm reduction interventions for Indigenous youth. This dissertation examines three sets of interrelated questions regarding novel interventions designed to prevent and reduce AOD harms for youth of color (YOC), with a focus on the needs of Indigenous youth who participate in an Indigenous-specific after-school program. The first study reports use, usability, and overall satisfaction outcomes for the MyPEEPS (Male Youth Pursing Empowerment, Education, and Prevention around Sexuality) mobile app, an evidence-based HIV prevention intervention. A pre-post pilot feasibility study was conducted with racially and ethnically diverse 40 young men living in Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; New York City, New York; and Seattle, Washington. Results indicated 62.5% (25/40) of all participants completed the intervention in an average of 28.85 (SD 21.69) days. Overall, participants reported the app was easy to use and useful and had the potential to improve their sexual health knowledge, behaviors, and awareness in risky situations. The second study focused exclusively on the AOD prevention needs of Indigenous youth towards the development of a culturally relevant and theoretically grounded harm reduction intervention. A community-based participatory research approach was used to understand the perceptions of AOD use, harm reduction and culture among Indigenous youth 13-17 years of age enrolled in an Indigenous-specific after-school program. Key themes were organized with the Indigenous framework of Relationality and included: a) youth understand the negative consequences of AOD use, b) youth appreciated balanced, non-abstinence based AOD education, c) youth described a need for safe opportunities to talk about the impacts of AOD use, and d) youth described a desire to lead and help prevent AOD harms for their future selves and for those in their circle. The third study examined perceptions of Indigenous adults (18+ years of age) affiliated with the same Indigenous after-school program regarding AOD use, harm reduction, and risk factors for youth participants. Findings were organized using a risk environment framework to identify risk factors for youth on micro and macro levels across physical, social, economic, and policy domains. Last, adult-identified risk factors were paired with the previously reported youth recommendations where similar, to establish core content for a community-based, culturally relevant, and theoretically grounded harm reduction intervention for Indigenous youth, inclusive of multigenerational Indigenous perspectives. Results of these studies strongly indicate that harm reduction interventions as an acceptable approach to prevent AOD use and harm among diverse YOC. In addition, findings support culturally relevant harm reduction education as a valuable way to prevent AOD use and harm among Indigenous youth participating in an after-school program. Future research should seek to explicitly test the hypothesis that interventions designed to enhance relationality among Indigenous youth can serve to buffer risk for AOD use and harm. Finally, meeting the needs of diverse YOC requires a community-based approach. Trust and respect must be established in order to develop a mutually beneficial research partnership with representatives from diverse populations and communities."

Yet the dynamics and historical relations between museums and these populations have been contentious at best. This dissertation examines museums and their history through an Indigenous lens. It explores how the museum field has changed and enriched its philosophical and educational missions due to the modification of collections, curatorial, and conservation practices brought about by Native American and First Nations peoples. It addresses how this has transformed museums across the globe and has impacted the field of museology through the delivery of a more inclusive museum studies curriculum."

Fernandez,2019,Dissertation,Social Work,Social work; Public health; Native American studies,University of Washington,1131722937,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/items/866ddbcb-1af9-422a-a22f-36bbd37da308,Record,47.65791637,-122.3068518,Text,"Background and Purpose:

In 2012 the U.S. Census Bureau used “Mexican American Indian” (MAI) as a new category to describe people with ancestry from Indigenous groups of Mexico. This census category comprises the fourth largest Indigenous population group in the United States and encompasses a vastly diverse, complex, and intersectional population, for which there is little empirical health research. Many Indigenous scholars and community members cite involvement in place- and settings-based cultural and spiritual practices as potentially protective in reducing health risks and promoting well-being. The aim of this study is to understand the role of participation in cultural dance as a potential protective place for reducing alcohol and other drug abuse (AOD) and HIV risk, and for promoting overall health among a sample of people from an Urban Danza Mexica Community (UDMC). Narrative, as storytelling, is a powerful medium of communication with the potential to uncover important risk and protective factors among Indigenous communities globally.

Methods:

This study is a secondary data analysis (n = 12; 9 included in the final analysis) of a larger qualitative AOD and HIV prevention study with UDMC in the Pacific Northwest (n = 21). The larger pilot study uses a community based participatory research approach to assess AOD, HIV and overall health needs through in-depth interviews. This secondary analysis introduces the decolonizing narratives of health (DNOH) model, developed by the author as an innovative, relational, analytic framework that places Indigenous stories in relationship to their context across 3 distinct yet interconnected levels—the personal, the communal, and Indigeneity in the larger world. These levels of narrative analysis function as culturally grounded, relational pathways through which to articulate health prevention and promotion methods. The sample of 9 participants identified ancestry among 4 Indigenous groups from across Mexico. Their ages were evenly distributed across younger and older adult cohorts (18+) with education levels from 0-8th grade, to graduate/professional degrees. Five participants self-identified as cisgender female, and 4 as cisgender male. Among the 9, one participant identified as cisgender two-spirit.

Results:

The DNOH model’s narratives delve into the complex and nuanced relationships within participants’ internal worlds (personal), between themselves and their danza community (communal), and between themselves and their overall Indigenous identity within society (Indigeneity). Participants use narrative as a mechanism for resistance to colonial assaults and transmission of ancestral teachings about health and prevention. While marginalization of their intersectional identities is an ongoing challenge, participants within the danza circle use narratives to create spaces wherein they navigate complex conversations that resist oppression, reconnect with and strengthen their Indigenous identities, and strive toward ancestral visions of health and well-being.

Conclusion and Implications:

This study contributes to Indigenized theoretical and methodological expansion, and to the development of place/settings-based, narrative cultural health interventions aimed at decreasing health risks and promoting wellness among populations similar to UDMC. Identifying protective places and spaces that foster distinct pathways for decolonizing narratives helps increase understanding of its role in preventing health risk behaviors and promoting overall health and well-being among Indigenous Peoples"

Indigenous women have been historically marginalized as they have poorer reproductive health outcomes and possibly higher prevalence of violence against them. More information on Intrafamily Violence (IV), Violence Against Women (VAW) and in eliciting indigenous people’s perspectives on these types of violence is needed. This qualitative exploratory study aims to fill this literature gap by exploring perceptions of VAW within the IV concept among members of two multiethnic indigenous communities in VaupÃ©s, Colombia through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) as well as In-Depth Interviews (IDIs). Our most notable findings were gender differing views, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of interculturality between indigenous people and western service providers (health, justice, and protection), as well as a perpetual macho culture affecting future generations in these communities. Loss of culture was the fundamental theme which encompassed every single perspective of these types of violence. From the social disorder to the differing perspectives between men and women, losing the indigenous culture is closely knit to intrafamily violence increase and inhibits the concept of living well, “Buen Vivir”. Indigenous women in this region would benefit from a co-designed organizational strengthening process between indigenous authorities and western institutions to further prevent the loss of culture and regain traditional practices that will mitigate IV/VAW and promote Buen Vivir."

It deconstructs outdated misconceptions about aboriginal basket weaving practices and cultural identity in Southern California. In 1922 Alfred Kroeber wrote the first anthropological account of ""Mission"" Indian baskets. Kroeber used the word ""Mission"" to describe a specific style of basket weaving attributed to certain indigenous communities based in Southern California. This thesis explains why the term ""Mission"" is problematic when used to categorize baskets. I argue it is best that museums and collectors identify a basket by the name of the weaver who made it and his or her tribe. Some scholars have tried to argue that traditional indigenous arts only existed in the past, but this thesis proves that tradition changes as a result of outside (native and non-native) influences and new ideas."

It examines the broader meaning and significance of the federally-funded boarding school education provided to Indigenous female students at Chemawa during this period of educational reform in which the long-time emphasis on gendered vocational education for Indigenous youth, reinforced by the settler colonial paradigm of a strict sexual division of labor, became part of a broader movement in public education nationally. This movement strongly reinforced restrictive gender roles and was philosophically justified by its proponents based on influential theories of social efficiency and social evolution of the period. By demanding forms of education that fit their needs and desires and actively seeking these forms of education, some female Indigenous students carved out spaces of maneuverability and access within and beyond the Chemawa campus. Female students helped negotiate the malleability of this space and used it as a launch pad for greater opportunity. Chemawa female students’ resistance took two distinct forms: advocacy for choice and self-definition. Many existing stories of Indigenous youth resistance in education--including those told by David Wallace Adams, K. Tsianina Lomawaima and Theresa McCarty--are stories of students turning away from schools. By contrast, the stories of female student advocacy at Chemawa told here are examples of Indigenous youth turning toward education and actively negotiating for different options. Their resistance was to a restrictive vocational curriculum, not to education itself. The period of this study, between 1900 and the 1930s, marked a fascinating time in federal perceptions of Indian education through assimilation. This was the heyday of government off-reservation Indian boarding schools. By 1931, twenty nine percent of Indian children in school were in government boarding schools. This period is also described by Frederick Hoxie as the ‘second phase’ in the assimilation program in which the US Government aimed at incorporating Indigenous peoples into the American society, but not on equal terms as whites. Sex-segregated vocational education in off-reservation Indian boarding schools was an essential component of this assimilationist program that sought to shape Indigenous identity in a fashion that would be both useful and non-threatening to white American society. In this second phase of assimilation, prejudices against Indigenous lifeways came to define policy that did not seek to equalize Indigenous people, but rather firmly position them in subservient societal roles. By seeking out secondary and higher education, and professional education that offered paths to financial independence, female Chemawa students defined how they would pilot themselves and their people in the changing world. Part of this self-advocacy was challenging educational policy, which attempted to force them into narrowed fields of work. To some extent, Chemawa school leaders and BIA agents tried to respond to these demands on the part of female students by negotiating additional opportunities for some of the school’s most successful self-advocates. In the end, however, these local administrative efforts to accommodate female student demands and aspirations, proved limited in scope and duration. In keeping with policies at the federal level during the Depression, Chemawa, like other BIA schools reinforced a narrow definition of appropriate education for Indigenous female students even as a number of students themselves sought more “mainstream” opportunities. The stagnation of the Chemawa curricula during this period represented the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ resistance to the changing role Indigenous youth were advocating for in broader society. It also represented the entrenchment of a social efficiency educational paradigm that resisted the changing roles women were playing in the labor market. The way Indigenous girls perceived their role in the changing Industrial world flew in the face of a social efficiency educational paradigm which tried to relegate them to positions of un-paid or low-paid domestic labor. The educational self-empowerment of these Indigenous girls disrupted the perceived boundaries of control of Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding schools as well as threatened the intentions of the settler colonial paradigm, a paradigm which was designed to weaken Indigenous identities and disenfranchise Indigenous people."

The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with Colombian research institutions and other ministries, designed a Comprehensive Health Care Model with an approach based on the principles of ethnic and cultural diversity within primary health care. In 2016, the Ministry of Health selected the Province of Guainía to host the five-year pilot of this model to target disperse rural communities, due to its diverse population and adverse topographic, health, and economic conditions. This research explores the perspectives of key stakeholders, directly or indirectly involved in implementing this model for indigenous populations living in disperse areas in Guainía, Colombia. The two main goals of this thesis research are to describe how different stakeholders perceive the model’s implementation in the local indigenous population of Guainía, and to identify to what extent this model is addressing the needs of indigenous populations living in disperse areas of this Province. In this descriptive qualitative research, 23 semi-structured interviews were conducted during July and September 2017. The term “Interculturality” was identified as the main overall theme. Specific sub-themes derived from Interculturality including 1) contextual disconnect, 2) prior consent, 3) “traditional” medicine, 4) transit homes, and 5) SISPI vs MIAS. Narratives collected for this project suggested that the model is promising, but it could increase success by adjusting some of its community-based participation, methodological, and epistemological approaches."

Much of urban development has been constructed as part of the settler colonial project that has sought to replace Indigenous land tenure through destruction of Indigenous lifeways on the landscape, in order to build something new as settler colonialism has always destroyed to replace (Wolfe 2006). But the lands on which cities reside continue to remain Indigenous lands so long as Indigenous people continue to relate to them. Landscape architecture as a field and discipline works with the land as its medium, and yet the discipline has yet to truly acknowledge the implications of Indigenous tenure on the lands on which they work and shape in North America, and have failed to examine the discipline’s role in the settler colonial project. As a student of landscape architecture and an Indigenous person, I have sought to first situate myself in the lands I live in as a visitor as a first step in acknowledgement of Indigenous lands and people of Dgheyey Kaq’ as a means to interrupt the dominant narratives of the history of our cities. In doing so, I have attempted to get to know the city through a different lens and through embodied experience by walking three of its urban streams that were important to Dena’ina peoples who shaped and named this landscape. Walking through ancient pathways through a contemporary city revealed opportunities for an already emergent Indigenous identity to grow into an Indigenous urbanism that could help shape how people see and live in the city and give an Indigenous voice to the narrative of the city as a place."

Twenty-five foster care alumni, relative caregivers and foster parents provided their perspectives and life experience of child wellbeing within ICWA preference placements. The use of directed content analysis and Indigenous storywork helped make meaning of the knowledge bearers’ stories in comparison with an Indigenous Connectedness Framework. Results indicate that: 1) relational wounds and trauma must be acknowledged and addressed; 2) relational continuity is a crucial for wellbeing within child welfare, and 3) relational healing happens when children and adults know who they are and where they come from. This study is significant because it shifts the narrative, philosophy, values, beliefs and theory of child wellbeing within child welfare and influences how we live in right relationship with ourselves and others for the benefit of our sacred children."

I begin by assessing the incongruity between the U.S. Department of the Interior and Bureau of Indian Affairs’ recognition of a configuration of Gayogo̱hÃ³꞉nǫˀ (Cayuga Nation) leadership that differs from the Nation’s leadership as recognized by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, of which the Gayogo̱hÃ³꞉nǫˀ are a constituent Nation. Analyzing an archive of U.S. federal executive and judicial decisions pertaining to Gayogo̱hÃ³꞉nǫˀ law, governance processes, and leadership configuration, I detail the U.S. settler state’s attempted apprehension of Gayogo̱hÃ³꞉nǫˀgovernance and jurisdiction, enabled by its predicate failure to heed the governance authority of Gayogo̱hÃ³꞉nǫˀ Clan Mothers, and the Great Law of Peace from which their authority flows. Theorizing from ongoing solidarity efforts, grounded in cross-national relationships of care that embody the foundational principles of the Two Row Wampum Treaty, I call for settlers to more actively attune and attend to the quality of settler-Indigenous governance relationships, inviting settlers into what I term a more dynamic inhabitance of settler subjectivity. I suggest that future research take a more capacious approach to theorizing and tending governance and treaty relationships, as this may yet yield additional methodological insight for building more engaged forms of settler accountability to ongoing and future geographies of Indigenous governance."

How might a Native Lenca community displaced from Honduras make intentional kinship with the Paayme Paxaayt (West River in Tongva language) also known as the Los Angeles River? While popular understandings of immigration center on labor and Latinidades, many immigrants are Indigenous and bring with them different languages and relationships to land (Hondagneu-Sotelo, 2014; Stephen, 2007). Understanding mobility as a strategy for survival is tied to Indigenous ontologies of kinships and lessons learned from nonhuman worlds like lands and rivers. This relational understanding recenters land as pedagogy where nonhuman beings like rivers serve as teachers by working with Indigenous peoples against the settler-state. Indigenous peoples in diaspora then employ migration as a form of mobility that highlights sovereignty over their own bodies by refusing settler rule through the crossing of multitudes of borders. Urban geographies like Los Angeles serve as settler borders by uplifting white supremacy through geographical imaginaries and discourses that deny Indigenous presence within urban cities undermining Indigenous futurities through the encasing of land within concrete.Through migration, Los Angeles has become a hub for Indigenous peoples in diaspora who challenge settler imaginaries by focusing on their rights to self-determination and transforming urban spaces through intentional nonhuman kinships. They intentionally form new commitments to new lands by engaging in new alliances with other Indigenous communities and nonhuman worlds. Through storytelling I’ll explain how Indigenous peoples in diaspora from Abia Yala carry land within themselves, transforming public spaces, front/backyards, balconies, and alleys into community spaces of care that chip away and crack the concrete bringing forth Indigenous existence and futurity within urban spaces through kinships."

This dissertation is focused on a case study related to these questions. The case study concerns the digital archiving of learning materials for Yakama/Yakima Sahaptin (Ichishkíin Sɨ́nwit) and the process of leveraging these resources for the development of online learning content. A needs analysis was conducted for the Yakama language community as a means of providing further community oversight of the projects.

On the Columbia Plateau, in the interior Pacific Northwest, the Canada-United States border ran through the aboriginal territories of the Ktunaxa, Sinixt, and Okanagan Nations. Through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these Native nations resisted, undermined, negotiated, and accommodated the border’s presence in their homelands. The activities, relationships, and movements of these indigenous communities across the forty-ninth parallel made the region into a borderlands. In lieu of a formal border patrol apparatus, Canada and the United States used federal Indian policy, situational violence, and land settlement practices to enforce the border among these Native nations. The international boundary served as a tool of settler colonialism, and vice versa. Native peoples relocated to reserves in British Columbia and reservations in Montana, Idaho, and Washington as a means of retaining political sovereignty and a land base. Their political reorientation towards the reserve or reservation and towards a relationship with one or the other nation-state in effect reified the border’s meaning as a marker of national domain. However, Ktunaxa, Sinixt, and Okanagan bands and families continued to engage in cultural and spiritual practices and kin-based relationships across the boundary line well into the twentieth century. These transborder activities disrupted Canada and the United States’ efforts to control the movement of indigenous bodies and maintain the separation of Native homelands at the line. A focus on the activities of Native communities in the Canada-United States borderlands reveals the contingent nature of border enforcement and the nation-states’ struggle to control national peripheries. This perspective also shows how indigenous nationhood endured colonial institutions of division, isolation, and assimilation delineated by the international boundary."

Often the strategies that are available speak only to their indigenous identity or their gender, but not to both simultaneously. This sets up a kind of double bind, when remedies for domination based upon one aspect of one's identity actually entrenches domination based upon another identity facet. This is a study of power, law, and identity, which assumes that legal norms have multiple interpretations, hierarchies are deeply entrenched yet also change over time, and domination and resistance happen simultaneously. Given these theoretical underpinnings, how can indigenous women mobilize the law? This study urges legal scholars to interrogate the problematic of intersectional power, such as the combined effects of race and gender domination.An in-depth comparative analysis of ""marrying out"" cases in the US and Canada helps elucidate how indigenous women might mobilize the law. These are cases where indigenous women marry men who are not members of their tribe or band. By marrying out of their tribes/bands, these women either lose their ""Indian"" status, or are unable to pass such status on to their children. In examining these cases, conflicting legal strategies become apparent, showing that indigenous women have few legal tools that allow them to articulate their unique identities. The analysis of these cases focuses on discourse and considers legal arguments within six discursive frames: (1) individual civil rights, (2) sovereignty rights, (3) membership standards, (4) tradition, (5) jurisdiction, and (6) economic and material forces. These frames show the plurality of legal tools which serve to further domination over indigenous women, and provide seeds for their future resistance. The study concludes that the impact of indigenous women's legal mobilization should be assessed in terms of the potential for future democratic participation, or new opportunities re-evaluate the meaning of rights. The democratic value of rights discourses lies in the possibility for ascribing new meanings to them. Therefore, legal mobilization might help alleviate the double bind of intersectional power only if it provides indigenous women opportunities to redefine rights."

This is qualitative multi-case study of two IBE preschools in Región Metropolitana, Chile. The objective of this study was to examine the nature, purpose and quality of the relationships between preschool teachers and Mapuche communities in IBE preschools in Región Metropolitana. Understanding teachers and other community educators in intercultural and bilingual preschools presents an important area for empirical study that, so far, has been mostly ignored by research. By investigating those people who closely work with Indigenous children we can better examine to what extent IBE preschools work towards the preservation of Indigenous knowledge and improved education for Indigenous children; or rather IBE may simply be recreating “citizen factories” (Luykx, 1999). Using semi-structured interviews, focal observations, group conversations, and school and policy documents, this research is an account of the partnership between IBE preschools and Mapuche communities. Specifically, this data examines: how IBE preschools and Mapuche communities began their collaboration, how teachers and Mapuche community members interacted and worked together, and what learning experiences occurred within this partnership. Analysis examined the points of intersection for these three dimensions. The analysis of this data yielded a number of interesting findings. First, IBE preschools and Mapuche communities struggled in creating a collaboration. But, although their partnership was determined by larger structures, IBE preschool and community actors found some initial spaces of trusting collaboration between one another. Secondly, in their interactions, teachers and community members sometimes reproduce systems of exclusion and marginalization towards Mapuche knowledge, and also exerted their power against Mapuche community members. But, at the same time, teachers worked in protecting their relationships with Mapuche communities. Additionally, findings showed that despite differences and difficulties, teacher learning emerged in these hybrid spaces. These findings can contribute to building more sophisticated models of interactions between teachers in IBE preschools and Mapuche communities. In the larger context, these findings can contribute to the fields of: Indigenous education across countries, the inclusion of Indigenous communities in educational systems, and the preparation of teachers to improve the education of historically excluded families, communities, and children."

This thesis aims to document several environmental justice cases that have occurred in the Pacific Northwest U.S. (PNW) against or in favor of the Coast Salish peoples since the 1960’s Fish Wars. The environmental justice cases will consist of both environmental victories and injustices that impact and affect the Washington state tribes. For the purposes of this thesis, environmental justice is defined as a theory and framework utilized to describe grassroots movements led by communities of color to protect and advocate for their well-being, livelihoods, resilience and Mother Earth. The environmental justice cases documented in this study will be utilized to develop an environmental justice atlas and website. The environmental justice cases will be coded to determine the indigenous pillars of environmental justice for the Pacific Northwest U.S. The indigenous pillars of environmental justice will identify the important tribal and cultural values for the Coast Salish tribes and nations. These indigenous pillars of environmental justice will allow policy-makers to shift from distributive, process,procedural and recognition justice by incorporating cultural values, tribal sovereignty, and community mapping. It is important to acknowledge that environmental justice is a complex issue in Indian Country, therefore, there are no simple solutions to address environmental justice provided in this thesis, but rather initial tools to start building, adapting, and applying the environmental justice concept to the specific context of the indigenous experiences in the United States."

It seeks to understand the impacts of climate change in historical context, especially in relation to settler and welfare colonialism. But it also broadly considers the question of what political options and practical strategies are being created by frontline Indigenous communities, like Kivalina, whose desires and needs exceed the capacity of existing institutions to adequately plan or provide, in the midst of unprecedented environmental change. Conversant with the environmental social sciences and the environmental humanities writ large, the dissertation offers a critique of prevailing approaches to climate risk, displacement, vulnerability and adaptation in the Arctic, while also articulating community-based modes of knowledge production grounded through a commitment to Indigenous sovereignty. It does this while also theoretically situating the bodily risks and structural violence of climate change in the context of contemporary Indigenous political theory and the particular genealogy of colonial biopolitics in Northwest Alaska. Above all, this dissertation is a testament to the strength and creativity of Kivalina’s people who have, time and time again, maneuvered within, against, and beyond the entanglements of colonialism so as to hold open the possibility of a just, healthy, and self-determined collective future."

In these areas, efficient management of competing uses frequently relies on economic valuations. Often eluding valuation and thus failing to meet capitalist standards of economic efficiency, unique coastal ways of life and their associated cultural identities are increasingly at risk of being lost. This potential loss of cultural identity is particularly important to indigenous peoples. However, for the nation's many persistently poor Native communities reducing poverty, achieving self-determination and revitalizing culture often require engaging with the same capitalist system that threatens traditional ways of life. In the case of Alaska Natives, this relationship has been formalized by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act which tied Native prosperity and sovereignty to capitalism through a system of Native corporations. This thesis employs the case study method of qualitative research to examine the economic development strategy of one of these entities; Sealaska Corporation. After identifying relevant theories and concepts, a historical approach is employed to identify important events and patterns in Sealaska's past involvement with economic development efforts. Tourism is then evaluated as a potential component of culturally relevant and environmentally sustainable economic development. The tension between achieving financial profitability and maintaining cultural identity emerges as a key challenge for Sealaska. In addition, it is found that development of innovative cultural and nature-based tourism products represents a significant but currently unfulfilled opportunity for the Corporation. Tourism appears to be uniquely flexible in its ability to balance the competing goals that emerge from the interaction of capitalism and Native cultural, and therefore strategic tourism development is recommended for Sealaska Corporation. Following from these findings it is concluded that innovation represents an important middle ground between overt hostility towards capitalism and cultural assimilation."

As such, the purpose of this study was to examine decolonizing practices in collections management databases in museums with Indigenous collections. Those selected for study included privileging of the following practices: incorporating Indigenous knowledge (perspective, language, and protocols), accepting Indigenous authority, and providing Indigenous peoples access to information and objects in museum collections. The first method in this phenomenological study used semi-structured interviews with seven collections specialists about their experiences with collections management databases and decolonizing practices in six institutions in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The second used document analysis of three institutions’ collections policies and decolonizing initiatives. Findings suggest all museums had collaborated with source communities about Indigenous knowledge entered into the databases, but the extent of capabilities and utilization of decolonizing practices in collections management systems was inconsistent. None of those interviewed had discussions with Indigenous communities on the choice of the current collections management database, though a majority were in the process of seeking new collections management systems to replace those that had been in use for ten or more years in the museum. Access to the database was also inconsistent, and particularly dependent on system features. Limitations of this study included the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on scheduling interviews, the time needed to complete the research, and the final sample size potentially not being representative of all museums."

Schools in the Philippines have been patterned after the United States educational system, thus the training in music has been traditionally in Western music, until the composers later begin to study their roots as if it were something foreign. This dissertation seeks to aid in understanding these roots as it was first rediscovered and studied by Jose Maceda (31 January 1917 — 5 May 2004), the first ethnomusicologist and avant-garde composer of the Philippines. Through a lookat his life and works with a focal point on his work “Pagsamba”, this dissertation will analyze the non-Western musical elements and philosophies that permeate much of indigenous music. At the same time, Maceda utilized avant-garde compositional techniques as a canvas to display these indigenous musical sonorities. These concepts sparked a movement that allowed for composers in the Philippines to embrace their roots and further expand upon the growing repertoire that is"

This dissertation draws from a diverse collection of archived writings and publicity materials produced by La Alianza over the span of its roughly 15 year existence and situates the movement as a rich site of cultural production. I consider these documents as an archive of subaltern history writing that countered nationalist histories that naturalize private property and sanction collective amnesia of Mexican and Native land dispossession under US sovereignty. By offering a sustained and critical engagement with La Alianza's history writing, this dissertation examines the movement's use of Indo-Hispano as a term invoking a past of mestizaje distinct from dominant Chicana/o imaginings of mestizaje. My analysis reveals the complex ties between Indo-Hispano and the political economy of New Mexican land grant tenure and dispossession. This project argues that Indo-Hispano re-writes the mestiza/o pasts of genízaro Indians, detribalized Plains and Pueblo Indian captives who were forcibly resettled into land grants as a buffer to protect the Spanish colonial interior in New Mexico from Plains Indian raids during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the context of genízaro Indian land grant tenure and loss, La Alianza's textual production challenges dominant understandings of Chicana/o mestizaje offered by Chicana/o, Latina/o, and Latin American studies. Indo-Hispano insists that mestizaje ought to be considered in a much longer history of colonial hybridity and gender violence in the Americas that is not bound to the Mexican nationalist version of mestizaje appropriated by the Chicana/o movement. In these terms, this dissertation reframes La Alianza's status in Chicano/a studies in a way that opens up the field's relation to indigenous studies and Latin American studies. From this perspective, I link Indo-Hispano to genízaro land tenure and loss in order to recuperate an alternative imaginary for indigenous land reclamation and mestizo/a hybridity in the Americas. I unearth this imaginary by reading Indo-Hispano alongside an array of multi-ethnic border narratives that center linkages between mestizaje and indigenous territoriality across the Americas. In other words, my focus on the writing of Indo-Hispano is also about rendering visible cognate indigenous modes of telling the past and reclaiming the land that inhere within a multiplicity of borderland positions. In particular, I read Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead and Ana Castillo's So Far From God as texts that give me a language to resignify Indo-Hispano's transnational, hybridized, and coalitional nature. At stake here is making the case for how the writing of Indo-Hispano converges with the temporalities of transnational indigenous land reclamation struggles of our contemporary moment."

It demonstrates how a heuristic of spiralic temporality helps us see relationships and purposes the settler temporal structure aims to make not just invisible, but unthinkable. “Spiralic temporality” refers to an Indigenous experience of time that is informed by a people’s particular relationships to the seasonal cycles on their lands, and which acknowledges the present generations’ responsibilities to the ancestors and those not yet born. The four chapters discuss the Pacific Northwest Fish Wars, several generations of Native women activism, Idle No More, and the No Dakota Access Pipeline movement respectively. Through a discussion of literatures from the same place, the heuristic helps make visible how the place-based values, which the movements I discuss are fighting for, are both as old as time and adapted to the current moment. In this way, spiralic temporality offers a different conceptualization than what the hegemonic settler temporality is capable of."

My dissertation, Mapping the Terms of Freedom & The Ongoing Refusal of Settler Imaginaries, traces the making and unmaking of settler imaginaries in Denver and the ways in which the city’s Indigenous communities choose to represent their stories of resistance to the world. I connect the way institutions of knowledge maintain settler imaginaries in place through the entanglement of visual and digital knowledge practices in settler colonialism. Using ethnographic, archival, and participatory research methods, I trace self-determined Indigenous representations of strength through the community-curated (Re)Mapping Native Denver art exhibit that maps Indigenous geographies and dismantles the logics implicated in the settler imaginary. Held at Denver University (DU) in 2021, the (Re)Mapping Native Art Exhibit stood as a site of public facing education, demonstrating the liberatory power of retelling geo-history on the terms of Indigenous peoples."

Many governments and environmental organizations recognize a need for wildlife conservation as the landscape undergoes rapid environmental change, but some conservation practices burden Indigenous communities that rely on access to wildlife as a means of subsistence and food security. Despite a collective desire for the continued proliferation of endemic species and sustainable population dynamics, many Indigenous Peoples continue to experience the failures of management efforts through inadequate consideration of their perspectives, needs, concerns, and strengths within the decision making process. Using several case studies and previous work done in collaboration with Alaska Native communities and other Indigenous Peoples, this study recognizes the widely-held perspectives of these groups in contrast with western environmentalism and typical natural resource management. Within the Alaska Native context, the five major challenges to the inclusive management of wildlife are, (1) cultural differences in definition and approach to natural resource issues, (2) disregard for the place of Indigenous knowledge alongside western science, (3) distribution of environmental impacts and the burden of conservation, (4) power imbalances, and (5) lack of trust and respect. Characterizing differences between these groups’ perspectives on environmentalism, decision making, and policy approach show clear evidence of a cultural divide and of shortcomings in current wildlife science and policy. In order to give Alaska Natives greater voice in wildlife decisions that impact their communities, management strategies must find a way to reconcile these differences and foster inclusive and engaging solutions that are both place-based and landscape-scale."

This project intervenes into postcolonial studies, American studies, and ethnic studies as I rely on the optic of U.S. empire to reveal the concurrent processes of Asian and Indigenous racialization historically and in cultural memory. Through a comparative approach to Asian American studies and Indigenous studies, I demonstrate how Hawaiʻi operates as an opportunity to reckon with the determinative force of U.S. empire in the imaginative realm of aesthetic production. Contrary to the belief that contemporary literature’s imaginative force can transcend or repair the violence of U.S. empire restoring voice to those whom empire violated, I theorize the desire for literary representation as a legacy of empire. Furthermore, I argue for a more contradictory understanding of contemporary literature, one in which the history of U.S. empire remains coercive and determinative. By examining narratives about and by Hawaiʻi based writers, commonly referred to as “local” writing, I argue that “local” writing often functions as a “resolution” to the past. While it makes visible the history of empire through the stories it tells, “local” writing often positions itself as evidence of contemporary Hawaiʻi as a multicultural paradise of universal belonging. Yet, I demonstrate how “local” writing can only “resolve” the violence of empire by perpetuating the erasure of Kanaka Maoli colonization in the present. I argue the genre of “local” writing both critiques and perpetuates the violence of Indigenous dispossession and liberal racial formation. This leads me to also argue for the limitations of literary narrative to reconcile or resist the violences of U.S. empire. Thus, “local” writing produces Asian migrants as “local” subjects, substitutes for Kanaka Maoli, in order to maintain U.S. settler colonial hegemony. My dissertation examines specific flashpoints of U.S. empire in Hawaiʻi in the 19th and 20th century with post-2000 literary and cultural production that reimagines these moments. Together, these cultural texts demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of “local” fiction to reckon with the history of colonization and its legacies in the colonial present. Thus, in order to resist the paradigm of U.S. empire and to reimagine alternatives to colonized spaces, I propose the possibility of a material politics that accounts for how imperial epistemologies constitute the realm of the historical and literary imaginaries. In refusing to collapse Kanaka Maoli and Asian settler into a false political and racial equivalence, I instead argue for the necessity of reorienting the figure of the “local” Asian settler reveals the continuation of U.S. nationalist and imperialist knowledge production in the present. This relationality between history and narrative conveys how imaginative practices undergo continual colonization. This situates my project at the juncture of settler colonialism, racial capitalism, and ethnic studies where my theoretical interventions identify how Hawaiʻi’s history and literary production reveals the limits of current Asian American and postcolonial studies. Thus, my project calls for alternative strategies of decolonization where the aesthetic imagination becomes a material site of decolonizing politics. As such, I theorize how this form of decolonial and anti-imperial politics needs to account for how the imaginative realm is structured by the history of U.S. empire."

Current approaches to K-12 and college level STEM education tend to exclude or marginalize diverse pedagogies and epistemologies, contributing to low rates of recruitment and retention of diverse student populations in STEM fields, both at college and occupational levels. This lack of diversity has resulted in institutional dynamics and environmental land management practices that have remained largely unchanged for decades in the United States. Management models also frequently fail to appropriately engage smaller stakeholders such as Indigenous tribes and local community members that hold valuable place-based environmental knowledge. Lack of diverse perspectives and reduced information results in suboptimal outcomes, both for local stakeholders and the environment. The goal of this research is to develop a framework for the inclusion of holistic environmental pedagogies and epistemologies in environmental science education and management, with an emphasis on partnership with Indigenous communities to achieve these goals."

This qualitative study included interviews with six Two-Spirit/queer Indigenous artists, using a phenomenological approach. Museums as cultural institutions built upon colonial ideals have the responsibility to amend museological authority that silence the voices of and refuse space to those that traverse intersectional identities. Two-Spirit artists examine the historical relationship of race, gender, and power as they pertain to material culture, contemporary self-expression, and art. Within this art they are Indigenizing Western academic spaces like museums, demanding accountability from institutions considered vessels of cultural knowledge. Findings suggest that curators’ willingness to listen, communicate, and engage in dialog is critical. The study also found that Two-Spirit artists’ work confronts heteronormativity by exhibiting shifts in gender roles across cultures and time and embodying the values of community organizing, storytelling, and survival."

There are several goals to this dissertation. One goal is to fill in an important gap in the literature on Lushootseed (and Coast Salish) phonetics, where the phonetics of Lushootseed is critically under documented. The goal is to characterize the pattern of speech sounds in Lushootseed by conducting instrumental acoustic analysis of speech sounds from these recordings. Another goal is to address questions concerning the morphology of Lushootseed that has not been previously investigated. Some of these questions concerns the morphological typology of Lushootseed, the position class of verbal affixes, allomorphs, the role of independent pronouns, as well as a descriptive overview of Lushootseed determiners. I cover several topics on the phonetics and phonology of Lushootseed. For one topic, I compare vowel qualities between the two dialects of Lushootseed, where I test the claim that there are dialectal differences in the realization of /i/ and /u/ (Hess & Hilbert 1976; Zahir 2019) by conducting an acoustic analysis of vowels across Lushootseed dialects. I found that the vowels are acoustically similar between the two dialects. Another topic that I cover is Lushootseed obstruents, where I conduct the first acoustic analysis of obstruents in Lushootseed. A third topic that I address in this dissertation is denasalization, which resulted in a voiced stop series. Although Lushootseed denasalization has been previously documented, an acoustic phonetic analysis of residual nasality in voiced stops has not been conducted. In this dissertation, I conduct the first acoustic phonetic analysis of voiced stops in such a way that can inform us about denasalization in Lushootseed. Another topic that I cover is the prosodic structure of Lushootseed, where I develop the first system of transcribing intonation in Lushootseed. Other topics include the coarticulatory effect of uvular consonants on vowel quality, the analysis and classification of ejectives, as well as an acoustic analysis of laryngealized sonorants in Lushootseed."

In my doctoral research, here presented in three articles, I make this argument through exploring the case studies of Rwanda and Guatemala, providing methods of analysis, and identifying opportunities for collaborative research. In part one, “New Documents Shed Light: Why did Peacekeepers Withdraw During Rwanda’s 1994 Genocide?”, an article published in 2018 in Genocide Studies and Prevention: an International Journal, I utilize the “critical oral history method” and analysis of recently declassified United States government records that shed light on the failed international response to stop the genocide in Rwanda. While methods used in this study elicit important information, the author finds that the study fails to include voices of people who suffered the consequences of these flawed polices. In part two, “Collaborative Archival Analysis & Co-Producing Knowledge,” I discuss the use of innovative archival analysis and “critical oral history” to address the flaws in the Rwanda project, drawing on important lessons from Indigenous studies and decolonizing methodologies. I apply these lessons in the case study of a collaborative project with the small town of genocide survivors in Nuevo Amanecer in western Guatemala. I argue that by broadening access to documents from the U.S.’ “colonial archive” about the Guatemalan genocide, we subvert the colonial archive in important ways. While these methods provide promise, future research needs to further develop these approaches. Finally, in part three, “Beyond Transitional Justice: Learning from Indigenous Maya Resistance in Guatemala,” I identify concrete lessons scholars and practitioners can learn from Indigenous scholarship when attempting to determine successes and shortcomings of the international community’s approach to transitional justice in the case of Guatemala. Through learning from the Indigenous studies concepts of refusal, survivance, and thrivance, as well as ideas of “damage-centered research” and “desire-centered research,” non-Native scholars can fundamentally reconfigure ideas of how to do their work by centering the voices and projects of communities who are building brighter futures. Ultimately, I conclude that non-Native scholars and practitioners can learn many lessons from Indigenous scholars and communities who are doing innovative future-building work, especially in the field of archival studies and transitional justice."

Based on extensive field research, I argue that the treaty protection of the right to consultation is central to the region-wide political mobilization against unwanted mines, but that its importance has rested not on the use of formal legal institutions like courts, but on the cultural importance of international law and human rights norms. Community activists and their nonprofit allies have been able to use Convention 169 and the right to consultation to their advantage by rhetorically invoking the legitimacy and authority of international human rights law, even though there have been few legal victories in court based on the right. My study complements “compliance” studies of international law and contributes to work on the cultural power of law."

As a case study, this thesis analyzes the coalition and advocacy alliances formed to stop the Gateway Pacific Terminal, a proposed coal export facility at Cherry Point, Washington, near the indigenous Lummi Nation. Interviews provide insight into the various environmental and faith-based actors that formed a relationship with the Lummi Nation. The results of these interviews show the Lummi Nation’s desire for community capacity building against potential exploitation and colonialism. Applying the Advocacy Coalition Framework to this case study demonstrates: 1) how this alliance has formed, 2) how it is affecting policy, and 3) what power imbalances may exist. Further analysis of this qualitative data provides guidance to indigenous groups and potential advocates on gathering their resources and uniting their core beliefs to successfully form future coalitions. On May 9, 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied the construction commencement permit of the Gateway Pacific Terminal project. This was the result of the Lummi Nation’s legal right to access their fishing grounds; however, the advocacy of the coalition brought additional pressure and influenced the permit process. This successful coalition highlights the ability of advocacy groups and indigenous communities to strengthen relationships and impact the policy process."

After more than forty years of development, tribal libraries have become important sites of decolonization, where sovereignty and self-determination are paramount. These libraries are relatively recent tools that Native (and non-Native) people have begun to employ to collect, preserve, and transmit Indigenous knowledge for current and future generations. Despite the important role these institutions play in many Native communities, their presence is relatively unknown in the scholarly literature. This research traces the history and development of tribal libraries using qualitative research methodologies informed by Indigenous approaches to knowledge. Interviews with early designers as well as with current tribal library designers were conducted to tell the story of tribal library development. Analysis of archival documents provided additional information on the development of tribal libraries. This research addresses the question, What was the basis for the development of tribal libraries? The result of this examination reveals that the basis for tribal library development included the following: 1. Inadequate library services for American Indians; 2. Federal responsibilities to Indian education; 3. The activism, leadership, and advocacy of the early designers of tribal libraries; 4. The era of Self-Determination; 5. Opportunities for American Indian library leaders, educators, community members, and allies to collectively send a message to the U.S. president and congress regarding American Indian library services; 6. A strong vision for tribal libraries; and 7. Linking American Indian culture to libraries. An understanding of these historical and current intersections is crucial to provide context to design and support information systems from Indigenous positions."

At this point in history, tribal leaders enforce the sovereign rights of tribes by communicating through information and communication technologies (ICTs) mobilized to work across powerful institutions. Tribal leaders who command the processes of broadband Internet deployment within their communities increase their capacity to support the health of tribal lands, waters, and peoples. Whereas freedom of expression and the exercise of all other human rights through the Internet is a human right, and the infrastructure for connecting to the Internet is essential for citizens to self-govern, so does the U.S. federal government, under obligation of the trust relationship they share with federally-recognized tribes, have a responsibility to support the deployment of broadband Internet infrastructure--including networks, devices, spectrum, technical expertise, and policies--throughout Indian Country. This qualitative inquiry reveals how tribal leaders who deploy broadband Internet to their communities must contend with national telecommunications policy, neighboring deployment strategies, regulatory matters, and the development of steady revenue streams to advance robust broadband network design and services. As each of these intersects with the sovereign rights of tribes, it is possible to conceptualize sociotechnical dimensions to future exercises of tribal sovereignty."

The research reveals how western approaches to conservation have disenfranchised Chamorros and undermined self-determination efforts over traditional lands and waters. Interviews with Chamorro participants highlight concerns over marginalization in equity initiatives, the challenges of addressing systemic inequalities within a colonial context, and the importance of centering Indigenous voices. By foregrounding Chamorro experiences, knowledges, and aspirations, this thesis highlights the need for a decolonial approach to environmental management in the Marianas that is grounded in Chamorro cultural values like inafa’maolek. Achieving equity requires dismantling prevailing power dynamics and co-creating solutions with Chamorros that honor the inherent rights and responsibilities to ancestral territory."

Entitled Indian Education For All (IEFA), the Montana law mandates that educators must include American Indian culture and history into the mainstream curriculum, requiring all students to learn that curriculum in a culturally responsive manner. It also requires mainstream educators to work cooperatively with tribal communities and Native educators in the design and implementation of that curriculum. IEFA promotes what I call an inclusive conversation, which brings whites and Natives into dialogue for the purpose of finding common ground on a shared topic. The scholarship on IEFA praises the law as an innovative multicultural education strategy that can sufficiently reform American Indian education. But this dissertation argues that inclusion is not sufficient to reform education for Native students in the context of public schools. Using recent theory in multicultural education, postcolonial and Indigenous studies, and political theory, I analyze and critique the concept of inclusion that pervades IEFA. Rather than an inclusive conversation, I argue that white and Native groups need to engage in decolonizing conversations that directly and explicitly address colonization and its enduring effects on tribal communities. A decolonizing conversation recognizes and is informed by what Indigenous scholar Gerald Vizenor calls survivance. It is only when white and Native groups and educators engage in decolonizing conversations centered on survivance that these groups can engage in conversations that will transform American Indian education."

I analyze the making of conservation territories through an ethnography of ‘Lote 8’, a nearly 4000-hectare lot in the YabotÃ­ Biosphere Reserve, purchased for conservation and titled to three Mbya Guarani communities following over a decade of struggle for their land. First, I explore how Lote 8 is produced and stabilized as a discursive object through a multi-scalar network of actors, institutions, and infrastructures, which extract political, social and material value through its representation. Then, I trace the relationship among property, indigeneity and the selva though the creation of the YabotÃ­ Biosphere Reserve in the early 1990s, the dispute over Lote 8 between the Mbya Guarani and a logging company at the turn of the century, and the negotiated conservation land purchase and titling agreement. I show how claims to ‘conservation citizenship’ produce new spaces to contest histories of racialized dispossession and negotiate rights otherwise foreclosed through legal avenues, as conservation networks become an audience for the enunciation of rights claims and a non-state arbiter of the recognition of Indigenous communities. Problematically however, where rights claims made to the state require legibility of land as Indigenous territory, recognition by conservation actors requires that Indigenous communities demonstrate their legitimacy as conservation subjects, making ‘negotiated rights’ contingent, imbricated with the political economy of conservation and always susceptible to being undermined. Finally, I examine the effects of (re)producing the selva misionera as an object of environmental management in the YabotÃ­ Biosphere Reserve and its area of influence. I show how provincial parks are socially produced through the embodied labor of park rangers, which extends through (b)ordering practices for managing the overlapping borderlands of the YabotÃ­ Biosphere Reserve and the national border with Brazil. I argue that accessing land titles through conservation entangles Indigenous rights with environmental management as it operates as a mode of extending settler colonial territorial control through the everyday enactment of conservation territories."

This dependency has led to many conflicts and negotiations, geographically and historically, between Alaskan Natives, the State of Alaska, and the US Federal Government in regards to indigenous land claims. Through tracing the geographical evolution of these land claims and their settlements within Alaska, this paper seeks to understand how land claims settlements have impacted Alaska Native’s participation in further developing Alaska’s natural resources, such as oil and gas, fish and wildlife, and timber. This paper focuses on the historical and geographic struggle to settle indigenous land claims which culminated into the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) passed in 1971. ANCSA is a piece of legislation passed through congress that stipulates for Alaska Natives to construct, own, and operate newly conceptualized for-profit institutions called Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) in order to receive any indigenous settlement land claims money. Since its passage, ANCSA has played a significant role in how participation in resource development is approached within Alaska, specifically in the construction of for-profit corporations heavily invested in resource extraction and development."

From the racist ethnographic displays of yesteryear to the often problematic living history museums of today, Native American interpreters have had to cope with the fundamental disconnect between the reality of contemporary Native American culture and non-Native individuals’ expectations of it. The purpose of this study is to understand the extent to, and ways in which, Native American interpreters at living history museums experience and deal with instances of racism while interpreting their Native history. This study was guided by Indigenous research methodologies, and includes interviews with six Native American interpreters working at sites across the United States. Using Derald Wing Sue's racial microaggression framework, this study found that all of the interpreters experienced racial microaggressions, and that they have found ways of mitigating the effects of their negative experiences. Living history museums can consider some of these mitigation techniques in order to encourage and maintain Native participation at their sites."

Chile is no exception to this phenomenon with regard to the Mapuche. Despite state rhetoric promoting Indigenous rights through identity-focused development, a pervasive sense of loss continues to impact Mapuche communities. This work utilizes interviews and conversations with Mapuche individuals to demonstrate what the author terms, rhythms of localized resilience, in the face of a rising collective concern regarding loss of Indigenous knowledge in everyday practice among Mapuche. The work examines how loss operates as a space which galvanizes resurgence strategies and individual agency towards recovery and rehabilitation. I offer an analysis of loss—examining the kinds of losses (material, political and affective) experienced by Mapuche individuals and communities, to argue that loss is in fact, paradoxically, a productive component within revitalization efforts. This work will examine one Mapuche practice, trueque, which emphasizes reciprocity as a mechanism for social wellbeing, as a lens for understanding Mapuche resilience and empowerment in six local communities in southern Chile. This work will contribute to the discussion of Indigenous revitalization efforts and knowledge production by examining the localized actions of resurgence taking place in response to state-imposed conceptions of Indigenous peoples’ needs. I suggest that the forms through which Native peoples interact on a daily basis as a method of intentional resistance against the colonial conceptions of indigeneity matter, they operate as rhythms of resilience, fostering long-term transformation stirring personal responsibility and collective commitment."

Using a Media Studies and Indigenous Epistemological framework, this thesis posits that news media deploy stereotypes of Native Americans in order to serve the primary goal of the U.S. government in relation to Indigenous peoples in the United States: the gradual elimination of Indian cultures through gendered violence, destruction of natural environments and exploitation of natural resources, and severely limiting indigenous sovereignty. My research design allows me to examine the construction of race and gender as processes of social interaction and power relations, and to analyze the media's role in colonization. It also allows me to illustrate some of the legacies of settler colonialism through telling the stories of my family. In this thesis, I analyze stereotypical representations of Native Americans in media in relation to the displacement of DinÃ© people from their ancestral land in the period surrounding the Long Walk of 1863-1864, and the internment of DinÃ© people at the Bosque Redondo until 1868. I employ a partially autoethnographic approach to highlight not only the generational impacts of settler colonialism, but also the impact on individuals. I also interviewed family members, searched for official documentation of deceased family members, searched church records, and have attempted to create a family archive with the data produced by these methods. This approach allows me to contrast dominant cultural narratives, many of which are constructed in the media, with the oral histories passed along through my family and the experiences of still-living family members in order to illuminate settler colonialism as a pervasive, ongoing process that impacts communities, families, and individuals in vastly different ways."

Future generations will bear the burden. Indigenous scholars have begun to address climate-based place changes; however, immigrant Pacific Islander populations have been ignored. Although Filipinos are one of the fastest growing U.S. populations, the second largest immigrant group, and second largest ethnic group in Hawai’i, lack of understanding regarding their physical health and mental wellbeing remains, especially among youth. This dissertation addresses these gaps. In response to Kemp’s (2011) and Jack’s (2010, 2015) impassioned calls for the social work profession to advance place research among vulnerable populations, this qualitative study examined Filipino youths’ (15-23) experiences of place(s) and geographic environment(s) in Hawai′i. Drawing on Indigenous worldviews, this study examined how youth narrate their sense of place, place attachments, ethnic/cultural identity/ies, belonging, connectedness to ancestral (Philippines) and contemporary homelands (Hawai’i), virtual environment(s), and how these places connect to wellbeing. Methods: Innovative, multiple, triangulated methods were employed to investigate primary research questions. Indigenous Methodologies (IMs), Filipino IMs, community participatory research, and feminist narrative inquiry offered culturally robust and grounded understandings of youths’ narratives. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 Filipino youth/young people. Feminist narrative methods (i.e., Gilligan’s Listening Guide) were adapted; “I” and “We” Poems enhanced findings to purposefully underscore individual and collective worldviews. Findings: Three overarching themes emerged: 1) Places as sites of wellbeing; 2) People make place; and 3) Spatial connections are associated with special places. Also salient were reciprocal, relational interconnectedness and interdependence between humans and nature, and Filipino cultural values: kapwa (shared identity), respect, gratitude (utang na loob), and responsibility to give back to ancestors and forward to future generations. Mentoring, socializing, and socialization processes were also significant. Conclusions/Implications: Findings from this inter-, transdisciplinary study will contribute to: 1) place and geographies of wellbeing literature among Island-dwelling populations; 2) development of culturally grounded positive youth development, environmental, and place-based health interventions for Filipino youth; and 3) policy development to better meet needs of increasing numbers of Filipinos and other Island-based Indigenous and immigrant communities with similar experiences."

It consists of three separate studies that all focus on moments of science teaching and learning that are intentionally situated outdoors. The second, third and fourth chapters are written as somewhat independent manuscripts, but they all revolve around the central concept of teaching and learning with and within complex ecological systems as influenced by nature-culture relations. The second chapter focuses on school gardens and is a case study of one garden educator working within a series of systems that influence her teaching. Culture and power are not often discussed in this context and human dominance is often taken as a given, reifying human exceptionalism. An analysis of the ethnographic data shows that normative and power-laden structures actually prevent her from sharing her expertise with students while she is teaching. I outline how those structures manifest in the garden lessons and the teacher’s moves of resistance. The third chapter investigates the role of teachers in science learning in the outdoors, positioning the natural world as an active agent in student learning. The researchers designed and implemented a curriculum that used Indigenous teaching methodologies. By adopting instructional practices that promote a relational standpoint to the natural world, instructors position children to draw upon the strengths of knowledge-in-context rather than asking them to integrate discordant epistemologies. Results suggest that instructional moves that draw attention to relationships and ascribe agency to the natural world facilitate a deeper understanding of complex systems reasoning. In the fourth chapter, the study examines the educational implications for Indigenous youth when stories are used as an epistemological tool to theorize about more-than-human beings. Youth were encouraged to observe and engage in the perspective of different rocks during a field-based Indigenous learning seminar. Using chronotopic analysis, the results showed that youth reasoned across a range of timeframes and ecological scales. This onto-epistemic flexibility may ultimately prove to be a key to encouraging agentic reasoning when teaching and learning about complex ecological systems."

However, climate change is threatening the future of coffee and is driving it out of places where it was historically grown. In Mexico, Chiapas and Oaxaca are two of the largest coffee producing states and have become victim to the impacts of climate change as it is altering the coffee production landscape, and creating an environment that may be unsuitable for coffee in the future. In a comparison of these two states, there are many similarities in terms of the coffee sector and demographics, but upon closer examination, starkly different patterns of civil society and political actions have been taken for climate change. For example, Chiapas passed a climate change law three years before Oaxaca. Focusing specifically on coffee, both local and international organizations in Chiapas are investing in coffee conservation projects, whereas in Oaxaca only international NGOs have been active in the coffee sector. In this comparative analysis of civil society dynamics, coffee, and indigenous politics, I offer plausible explanations for why there is a major difference in political and programmatic action within these two states. I argue that in Chiapas, a state that has been historically more democratic has created a space to engender bottom-up or grass-roots initiatives, giving rise to more progressive and community-based actions on climate change as a whole thus resulting in being more responsive and adaptive actions for the coffee sector."

Made in the absence of local representation, destructive land use practices have incited terraforming and hydrological alterations which this study projects will expose resettled residents to environmentally hazardous conditions amplified by key regional climate change risks, threaten cultural subsistence ties, and limit local adaptive capacities. In addition, this study suggests that top-down procedures of the project entail coercive tactics, negligence towards cultural needs and values, and failures to provide clear and consistent information, orchestrated to oppress opposition, legitimize, and mobilize the development of the resettlement site.

The research is grounded in archaeologies of survivance, which center Native presence, sovereignty, and futurity throughout the archaeological research process. As a concept, survivance is an important intervention within studies of settler colonialism, especially in North America, because it encourages researchers to consider multiple ways of knowing beyond the dominant systems of the academy. Epistemic diversity creates rigorous and robust research practices and interpretations, and often leads to new insights when data are contextualized within specific Indigenous epistemic communities. In this dissertation, an engagement with survivance has led to the co-creation of storytelling methods with collaborators in Old Harbor. These story methods work to both interpret archaeological data and effectively communicate and engage with the Old Harbor community. Story genres employed in this dissertation include story-models for hypothesis generation, fictive narrative, personal reflection, artistic reconstruction, and object-centered vignettes. These stories were generated as part of the Old Harbor Archaeological History Project (OHAHP). The purpose of OHAHP is to uncover Sugpiaq lifeways during the Russian colonial period (1760s to 1867 CE) in the Old Harbor region. This dissertation research focuses on labor practices, foodways, and elements of residence and governance among the people of Ing’yuq Village (KOD-114). Sugpiaq ancestors lived at Ing’yuq, located on Sitkalidak Island, for at least a century prior to Russian arrival in 1784, and persisted in place until the year 1840. This dissertation draws on data from archaeological excavations at Ing’yuq, critical examinations of the ethnohistoric and archival documentation of the Russian colonial period, and ethnographic interviews with Old Harbor community members to examine Sugpiaq negotiations of Russian colonialism. Analysis of these data reveal how Sugpiaq ancestors at Ing’yuq creatively maintained their relationships to their homelands through the tumultuous period of Russian occupation. Archaeofaunal remains from the Ing’yuq site show that people ate a wider variety of locally-procured foods and lived at Ing’yuq year-round during the Russian colonial period, which contrasts with indications of seasonal occupation in the century prior to Russian arrival. This signals a consolidation of the population, as men were sent away to hunt sea otter in distant regions for months at a time, and women pooled their labor to address Russian demands for goods. By reorganizing households, Sugpiaq families sought to maintain community even while so many relatives were lost to violence, disease, and removal. Analysis of belongings (a.k.a. artifacts) found that processing and manufacturing were the predominant activities in both the precolonial and colonial period deposits at Ing’yuq. That pattern roughly fits in with the characterization of belongings from other late precolonial and early colonial sites in southeastern Kodiak, suggesting a continuity of practice within these villages through time. The ubiquity of locally made pottery at Ing’yuq and the diversity of ulus found at the site suggest that Sugpiaq crafting traditions continued into the Russian colonial period, despite the increasing availability of imported goods through time. Storytelling is what holds these archaeological conclusions together and makes them make sense anthropologically and in community. The narrative that emerges from integrating the archaeological interpretations together is one of persistence and survivance by Sugpiaq people as they navigated, and continue to navigate, waves of Russian and American colonialism within their homelands. The use of collaborative storytelling in this dissertation contributes a novel framework for interpretation of the past. In using multiple storytelling strategies throughout this dissertation, I showcase a grounded method for making sense of archaeological data within an Indigenous survivance framework that weaves together cultural stories, archaeological data, personal narratives, and oral history to prioritize Indigenous experiences in our telling of Indigenous histories."

In recent decades, urbanization, infrastructure development, and cattle farming have driven landscape change in the municipality, potentially impacting the attributes that determine its future trajectories, namely its adaptive capacity to cope with climate change. 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore the community’s perceptions regarding observed changes in the landscape and their drivers. Additionally, this study was concerned with exploring the environmental justice issues unveiled by local narratives. Using content analysis, three main themes emerged: 1) Multidimensional impacts of forest cover and tree loss; 2) Changes in traditional food systems and economies; and 3) Change and its drivers are produced by and produce environmental injustices. Although perceived direct drivers of change vary spatially, land tenure systems, ineffective and weak policies, regulations and enforcement, and market forces explain indirect drivers underlying them. In the face of change, narrative accounts also display a community that resists through legal action and the keeping of its traditional practices. This research aims to ignite further inquiry and public discussion around questions of justice in social-ecological systems research, its intersection with regional planning, and indigenous and local knowledge inclusion and recognition in decision-making."

Grand Coulee Dam was built in 1942 in Washington state, destroying a major salmon fishery at Kettle Falls, thereby ending a 10,000 year lifestyle for the Colville Indians who lived on the river. This tribe and others on the Columbia River have subsequently been working to mitigate negative dam environmental impacts to restore fish and wildlife, so that they can maintain their cultural practices, and the entire region benefits from their efforts also. A key factor has been the oral traditions passed down from one generation to the next over thousands of years stressing the importance of protecting the environment for future generations Other examples are examined with other Indigenous people.

When construction began on the James Bay Hydroelectric facility in the early 70s, the Inuit and Cree of Northern Québec allied to take the provincial government to court for failing to properly consult them before undertaking this project on Indigenous lands. The James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement (JBNQA) was reached in 1975. This is arguably the first modern land claims agreement in Canadian history and is often considered one of the most successful agreements for Indigenous peoples in terms of monetary compensation. For the Inuit of Northern Québec (the Nunavimmiut), this agreement resulted in $90 million in compensation as well as provisions for hunting and fishing rights, and the creation of governance institutions for the Nunavimmiut including the establishment of the Makivik Corporation and the Kativik Regional Government. While these were remarkable achievements for the Inuit negotiation team, the JBNQA has a nuanced legacy. Even today, over 40 years after the signing of the JBNQA, there is still tension and dissatisfaction among Inuit communities over the results of this agreement. How can we explain the paradoxical status of the JBNQA as both a success and a disappointment in the eyes of the Nunavimmiut? How can we better understand the disagreement surrounding the legacy of the JBNQA and the tensions that continue to exist today over this agreement? This paper argues that examining the James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement through a framework of settler colonialism and resurgence explains these seemingly contradictory legacies."

First, I conducted an integrative literature review on environmental injustice that uniquely impacts Indigenous communities, specifically as it relates to water resources. I propose five major pathways through which environmental justice occurs: the physical manipulation of waterways, chemical contamination, the introduction of species, the exploitation of culturally significant species, and global climate change. The supplementary material for chapter one is an expanded list of all literature reviewed. In the second chapter, I present a framework for understanding food justice that integrates pre-existing theories of food justice, food sovereignty, and cultural sovereignty. In the third and final chapter, I have defined a theory of cultural-ecological resilience that builds from existing theories of social-ecological resilience to incorporate the non-tangible, cultural relationships between Indigenous Peoples and their traditional lands and waters. Using my framework for food justice from chapter two, I explore the ways justice within Indigenous food systems cultivates cultural-ecological resilience."

These trajectories, of Indigenous and Chicane activism, are reinforced by prior translocal organizing of Mexican immigrants in Seattle since the 1990’s with Grupo Cultural OaxaqueÃ±o. I analyze fandango practice, including its music, as a community space that supports critical consciousness and in turn becomes a support in shaping transnational fandango spaces. Through a decolonial feminist praxis my analysis of fandango explores how women dancers - bailadoras - contribute to the collective fandango soundscape by creating percussive sounds with their bodies, when their rhythmic stomping, or zapateado might be otherwise bypassed by a more standard analysis that would focus only on the fandango music that is played with instruments. As a practitioner, I also know that the music of fandango, and specifically of dancers, involves acute listening to others in the percussive field. Inspired by fandango’s sensorial pedagogies and the learning de a oido, I introduce the concept “radical relational listening” to explore listening on the tarima, platform drum center staged of fandangos, as a decolonial method oriented towards embodying relations––with the community and a larger human and non-human existence. This radical listening is animated by felt epistemologies or sentipensares; the acting of the heart using the head (Botero Gomez, 2019: 302). Bailadoras find pleasure in listening via feminist intimacy and through a willful enactment of collectivity through rhythms. In my study, I use the Indigenous concept of sentipensar to bridge radical relational listening with decolonial temporality. the tarima is a temporal and conceptual space where the ancestral memory of women gathers in the presence of community (human and non-human). As I argue, the cyclical footwork that bailadoras embody on the tarima, is the materialization of a decolonial temporality because, in addition to keeping time in music, the foot percussion that women embody on the tarima is not oriented towards capitalist individualism, but instead invites us to synchronize our bodies in horizontal relationships to one another and the land. In this way, the decolonial temporality that bailadoras sound out on the tarima through our zapateado disrupts colonial logics of consumption and individualized progress marked by the hegemony and monotonous single beat of a clock. Zapateado fandanguero is oriented towards building these relations in real-time and in the present by activating a collective memory that is ancestral and felt. Relational listening conceptualized on the tarima provides a point of entry to engage in dialogue, which is also the foundation of convivencia. I consider the bailadoras’ contributions to fandango not only in terms of the music, but also in fandango’s community building in their roles as the main organizers of the Seattle Fandango Project (SFP). By centering the analytical lens on the tarima, platform drum located at the center of the community music space, I highlight how by providing structure to the music through their cyclical foot percussion, bailadoras also influence the gender politics of the space and our collective consciousness. Lastly, the collective foot percussion of bailadoras provides me with the theoretical platform to explore fandango practice as a catalyst for expanding critical consciousness by building community across borders, which provides a foundation for strategically deploying technologies that counter state violence in Mexico and the US. Through a Women of Color and Indigenous feminist framework, my study of participatory traditions in Seattle’s Grupo Cultural OaxaqueÃ±o and the Seattle Fandango Project––seeks to bring visibility to the strategic organizing of Mexican immigrants and Chicanes fandango practitioners. Translocal fandango communities provide an opportunity to study embodied knowledge, affect, and joy as epistemological tools that facilitate transborder solidarity in response to state violence and capitalist oppression. By making visible fandango’s oppositional pedagogies, this dissertation reconsiders the depoliticization of AfroIndigenous participatory music traditions in the liberal university, and its conventional discourses that frame oppositional movements as exclusively conflictual and disruptive. I argue instead that building communities of social awareness around joy and dignity is a revolutionary act."

While these commonsense connections are commonplace in education research, the learning sciences have yet to produce either a theory or an analysis of ‘reflective action’ (RA) as an interactive phenomenon endogenously utilized by interactants as a resource for “onto-epistemological navigations” along interaction trajectories during situated learning activities. This dissertation sets out to address this gap. Drawing on the theory that learning is mediated by its situated assembling and webbing across layers of social inter- and intra-action, I build on frameworks positioning all action as emplaced and contextualized, socially distributed, and historically situated, to argue that it is also reflective along a malleable, non-binary continuum ranging from autonomic to autonomic-and-deliberate. Framing pedagogical communications and reflective discourses as specific caregiver and educator practices of reflective action, respectively, I adduce empirical findings to support conceptualizing “reflective discourse” (RD) as a set of pedagogical micro-practices that harness the inherent structure of human communication for educational purposes. To advances this position, I conduct interaction analysis on data collected from a community-shaped, design-based study of I-STEAM LARP (Indigenous Scientific Technological Artistic Mathematical Live Action Role-Play) to map if and how interactants expressed RA. The key finding, developed across three interdependent sub-findings, is that the plastic structure of RA made it a malleable interactive resource for laminating layers of onto- epistemic meaning onto I-STEAM LARP substrates through a process which I identify as “reflective discourse chaining.” Implications include recommendations for how reflective practitioners can make RAs publicly visible through the micro-practices of RD; a new theoretical framework for analyzing RA as a plastic and malleable interactive resource that adapts well for teaching-and-learning by virtue of its contingent and ostensive markings; methodological inroads to marking the presence of RA using a five-component coding scheme; and a novel analytic framework for analyzing educational discourses that shifts from the frames of IRE/F to the frames of RD to analyze how interactants participating in teaching-and-learning activities collectively web and accumulate meaning and understanding."

This study asks the two following questions: What does it mean to be Filipinx on Indigenous Lands? How do Filipinxs navigate the world? My co-researchers and I employed a Projects in Humanization, relational approach to exploring these questions within and beyond multiple Filipinx-themed undergraduate seminars I facilitated between 2017 and 2021. Our focus for the first question was elucidating Filipinxness in terms of group identifications (e.g., Filipinx, brown, Catholic). Our focus for the second question involved highlighting actions and commitments that we related to Filipinxness. I employed a constructivist, grounded theory approach to develop a theory of the saling-pusa, or “informal member,” as both ontological and pedagogical tool that involves refusal and desire. I propose that Filipinxs as saling-pusa on Indigenous lands lean into liminality as a strength and a place of radical possibilities toward being ourselves, teaching within and outside our communities, and solidarities with Indigenous peoples and other groups marginalized by systemic injustices."

But communities see them as something more.This thesis examines five historic school buildings within Seattle that have undergone a form of adaptive reuse, to examine the impacts of the process on the communities connected to those schools. In these cases there are alternative values that communities see in historic properties that the legal preservation system, and Seattle Public Schools do not. Within these case studies, it has been found that Seattle’s current preservation regulations favor white communities, and was more difficult for minoritized ones. Power is given to developers, not those with a stake in historic properties. The methods for determining significance are unsuitable for modern understandings of diverse histories, preservation struggles to listen when a community is not well established and defined, and lacks the collaboration or consultation to appropriately investigate the identities and values of communities that are supposed to be included in Seattle’s criterion c."

Archaeologies of survivance center Native presence in all aspects of archaeological knowledge production. In doing so, they address gaps in existing studies of European and US colonialism and position archaeological research as a counter to settler colonialism’s pursuit of Native absence. They also challenge archaeologists to shed their self-appointed role as narrators of Native histories and work collaboratively with tribal nations to bring the stories of their ancestors into the present. This dissertation puts an archaeology of survivance into practice via two community-based projects developed with and by the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. Combining cartographic, archival, archaeological, and community knowledge, these projects represent a Grand Ronde-specific form of historical inquiry, one that follows from community interests and strengthens the tribe’s efforts to implement self-determined heritage protection. This dissertation traces the development of these projects and explores what they reveal about nineteenth and twentieth century settlement patterns and foodways on the Grand Ronde Reservation in northwestern Oregon. Ultimately, an archaeology of survivance at Grand Ronde offers a blueprint for transforming a discipline rooted in US settler colonialism into a mode of tribal capacity building and continuation."

It examines how discourses of Native recognition and elimination organized distinct yet connected colonial projects of territorial management. It traces these discourses across photographic collections, poetry, narrative fiction, testimonials, ethnographic studies, and state records to approach them as “archives of post-occupation.” It argues that archives are key cultural technologies for producing relations of colonial control and resistance. Two interrelated questions guide this study: How do state operations of colonial control that have differentially represented and managed the territorial management of the Mapuche and Selk’nam peoples articulate forms of recognition and extinction? And how does the examination of different experiences of colonialism reveal Mapuche and Selk’nam’s paradoxical re-appropriations of the vocabularies of colonial control to assert their opposition to and negotiation with oppression? Chapter 1, “Extinction: The Selk’nam People and the Writing of the History of the Occupation of Tierra del Fuego” examines the deployment of the discourse on extinction that narrated the so-called disappearance of the Selk’nam people in the historiography of the Tierra del Fuego to trace the relations of oppression that reproduced capital accumulation and Indigenous forced displacement in the early twentieth century. Chapter 2, “Life with Extinction: Selk’nam Life in 20th Century Post-Occupation Tierra del Fuego” draws on photographic records and declassified letters to argue that extinction created the logics of a mode of life that negated but did not eliminate the Selk’nam people. Instead, it paradoxically organized Indigenous forms of living that continued to maintain relations with Selk’nam lands and waters under conditions of oppression. Chapter 3, “The Mapuche Diaspora: A Political Theory of Autonomy, Territory, Nation, and Difference” reads contemporary Mapuche political writing about forced displacement as political and cultural theories that articulate projects of Indigenous emancipation. Chapter 4, “FÃ¼tra Warria: The Cultural Dynamics of the Diaspora in the Colonial City” reads union newsletters and an ethnographic study of Mapuche settlement in twentieth-century Santiago to study residual discourses on Mapuche difference in Santiago that express the political and cultural transformation of Mapuche migrancy in the 20th century."

Opening in 1996, the Emerald Queen Casino, owned and operated by the Puyallup Tribe of Indians, is unique in Washington State in that it is located in an urban environment within the city limits of Tacoma. This unique geography has allowed the Emerald Queen to become one of the most prosperous Indian casinos in the Pacific Northwest. In this thesis I examine through factual data and autoethnography the positive and negative impacts of the Emerald Queen Casino on the Puyallup Tribe and the surrounding local community. Specifically, I focus on several of the benefits of the casino economy, including business and resource development, support of higher education, and creating opportunities for employment. I also focus on several of the detrimental effects of the casino economy, including complacency, drug abuse, and domestic issues. By exploring these positive and negative elements, we will begin to see how the Tribe has grown to become a vital component of the South Sound economy as well as having to contend with many longstanding and new social challenges in the Tribal community."

When a natural history museum is attempting to decolonize, they must do so at all levels of the organization. This includes the museum’s volunteer program. Volunteer programs are often vital to the success and even existence of a museum. Yet, in general, volunteerism in the Western world, has strong connections to inequity and white privilege. The purpose of this study was to discover the ways in which natural history museums who have indicated a focus on decolonization, are also incorporating their vision of decolonization into their volunteer program and the impact that those strategies have on volunteers. Using a qualitative case study design, data were collected from three natural history museums through semi-structured interviews, an online questionnaire, and document analysis. Findings suggest that volunteers who have attended trainings that incorporate topics related to decolonization and Native perspectives are more likely to be in support of museum decolonization, be more likely to feel that they can contribute to the decolonization of their organizations, and feel an increased empathy for Native American peoples. Furthermore, organizations that have focused on decolonization for a longer period of time have greater access to local communities and are better able to bring Native perspectives to their volunteers. Findings suggest a relationship between the incorporation of Native perspectives into volunteer training and increased empathy by volunteers for Native peoples. This study contributes to the greater conversation about museum decolonization and is intended to inform museum professionals on effective ways in which they can incorporate their museum’s decolonization practices into their volunteer programs."

However, research into digital geographies has not rigorously examined the role of the Internet in bridging epistemological difference. Rather, most of this research has focused on the digital practices of a narrow group of elite users, situated in the Global North and largely lacking epistemological diversity from one another. Those few studies that do shift their focus to the Global South either take an anthropological view of a single society, or focus on unidirectional impositions of the Global North on the Global South. In doing so, these studies similarly ignore any bidirectional dialogue, or interepistemological encounters, between digital users situated in very different regions from one another. To overcome that gap, this project focuses on a dispersed and highly international set of digital practices. Specifically, I analyze the emergence of digital, interepistemological encounters related to environmental thinking and climate change politics related to the Canadian Arctic. Issues surrounding the Arctic environment are ideal for this study because they have attracted a global and diverse audience. Debates around Arctic environment often produce debates between two different groups – Western scientists and Canadian Inuit – that hold very different epistemological perspectives from one another. Inuit are increasingly using the Internet to broadcast their voices to broader audiences, and there is some evidence that digital technologies are successfully allowing them to overcome the spatial distance between their Arctic communities and geopolitical centers of power. However, it remains unclear how effective these tools have been for overcoming differences in epistemology between Inuit and other digital users. I begin by drawing on diverse strands of postcolonial and Deleuzian theory to develop a theoretical framework capable of identifying how knowledge hierarchies are reproduced and disrupted across digital spaces. Using this framework and an innovative set of computational and qualitative methods, I identify three sets of digital processes that extend knowledge hierarchies into digital spaces. First, I find that the material infrastructure of the Web within the Arctic has intersected with colonial conditions to erode social practices that support the transmission of Inuit knowledge. Second, I find that Inuit have comparatively less access to the digital tools and spaces that might help them to transmit their knowledge to large audiences. Third, I identify a range of transformative, digital practices that flatten Inuit knowledge to a set of empirical observations, rather than as rooted in a comprehensive knowledge system, so that these observations can be integrated into Western scientific frameworks. Each of these sets of processes decreases the likelihood of transformative and pluralistic discussions between Inuit and Western scientific epistemological systems. However, I also find that Inuit are actively developing mediating concepts and practices to work against these knowledge hierarchies and open space for more epistemologically pluralistic digital engagement. This research thereby offers a comprehensive and empirically-grounded examination of how indigenous engagement with digital technologies produce new forms of epistemological politics. In doing so it extends geographic research on digital inequalities, digital participation, and knowledge production. It also offers a novel postcolonial framework for analyzing digital knowledge politics, and extends research into the role that digital technologies play in shaping international discussions about climate change."

Drawing from qualitative methods consisting of: archival research; ethnography; interviews of eight city leaders including the mayor of Pasco Matt Watkins; and the chief of the Police Bob Metzger; and from over 40 testimonios from mixed status immigrants, my research analyzes the ways in which undocumented Mexican immigrants construct thriving communities in places where they are not supposed to survive. To answer this question, I employ a transnational/trans-border approach because as I analyze how processes of imperialism, bordering, and immigration law have impacted agrarian communities in Mexico and Mexican immigrants in US cities, and in turn how immigrants themselves resist by adopting and readapting knowledge from the ‘South’ in order to produce communities of thriving in their everyday lives in the US. My community in Pasco and El Rancho reveal how acts of mourning (at funerals), celebrations (at weddings, quinceaÃ±eras, birthdays, etc), and kinship (co-parenting, compadrazgo) make each other strong, whole, and happy enabling a politics of thriving. It is exactly as Shawn Wilson says, we are our relations. In addition, I theorize that many of these rituals celebrate life (even at funerals) and as such, they serve as an antidote to social death – described as the permanent condition that the undocumented is forced to inhabit due to criminalization and denial of personhood through the law (Cacho 2012). However, based on my research, I refine this concept from all-encompassing social death to mean legal death – which means legal discrimination against access to what the state protects through the law including national borders, employment, housing, education, property, vote, and citizenship status. However far from permanent, legal death is a fluid condition in relation to the law. The law does not dictate all our relations and so does not have the power to fully take away social life, personhood and humanity; our multiple relations with people and place do."

As key subsistence and commercial fisheries, both ƛušuÂ·ʔaÂ· and łułubałid have contributed to Makah food sovereignty, conservation practices, and geo-political connectivity. Despite thousands of years of Indigenous borderland protocols and fishery self-governance, international agreements and laws establishing national marine borders of the U.S. and Canada have displaced Makah peoples from Swiftsure and 40 mile banks. Today, these imperial border formations over-determine the management of marine spaces through mechanisms such as the extension of the international border through exclusive economic zones (EEZs). Since the early 1900s, the Makah Tribe has strategically utilized the court and political system to regain recognition of many of their treaty-reserved fishing rights. However, efforts to regain ƛ̓ušuÂ·ʔaÂ· and łułubałid, have been blocked by the US and Canadian governments by enclosing the banks for exclusive non-native sportfishing uses, conservation, and other practices of settler border enforcement. Informed by critical Indigenous and border studies, this thesis crafts a “kin study” of the human-fish relations, knitting together ethnography, semi-structured interviews, historical archival data, publicly available government reports, policy and law to document the history of Makah efforts to restore access to Pacific halibut fishing and the significance of ƛ̓ušuÂ·ʔaÂ· (Swiftsure) and łułubałid (40 Mile or La Perouse)."

This is especially true for marginalized populations. Prior to this global crisis that has irrevocably compromised societal health and well-being [as measured by social determinant of equity (SDOE) indicators], there were several marginalized populations whose health needs were already not being met by medical systems1. One such population in the US are pregnant and birthing people. To decrease maternal mortality rates (MMR) and pregnancy related deaths (PRD), public health interventions need to address both proximal and ultimate gaps in reproductive and perinatal health care for people of color across the reproductive lifespan. The “supremacy of birth” creates an erasure of the spectrum of reproductive health needs and is a contributing factor in the myopic scope of largely clinical perinatal health interventions within public health to address these disparities. Simultaneously, structural racism and the historical legacies of reproductive violence inherent in the field of obstetrics have created maternal mortality disparities by race with Indigenous and Black populations most significantly impacted. Clinical and proximal interventions are not adequate to address the health disparities that exist due to a lifetime of structural oppression. In order to improve maternal mortality disparities and pregnancy related deaths, policy interventions must consider holistic reproductive health needs across three reproductive justice2 principles: 1) the right to give birth; 2) the right to not give birth; and 3) the right to raise children in safe and healthy environments. Utilizing a social work public health praxis for equitable health policy, our policy recommendation takes into consideration health care delivery systems and coordinated response mechanisms aligned with stakeholder needs not only specific to the urgency posed by the novel COVID-19 pandemic but also in preparation for future disasters. After carefully weighing policy options using a rigorous review of available literature and qualitative data collected using community partnered participatory practices, I am recommending the adoption of all three policy options. Each option targets different public entities, creating a multi-system approach across ecological layers. This kind of diverse approach is understood to be most effective in undoing systematic racialized policy harms3. Doing so is aligned with the evaluative criteria I have outlined: adopting all three options is financially responsible; addresses structural determinants of equity; centers the autonomy, pleasure, joy, and liberation of Black and Indigenous populations; and has the potential to improve intergenerational maternal child health outcomes."

Few studies have explored Indigenous perspectives on important factors to promote stronger engagement between researchers and Indigenous communities. This thesis examines Indigenous perspectives to identify the key cultural factors affecting genetic research participation. Semi-structured interviews with health professionals, policy experts, and tribal leaders in the US were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach and conventional content analysis. An important consideration for an individual's decision to participate in genetic research is influenced by his or her beliefs about genetics and biospecimens; these beliefs are shaped by one's spiritual understandings and cultural teachings. Considerations about the appropriate handling of biospecimens are also important, as people expressed concerns about respectful handling, control and ownership of biological samples, specimen disposal, its intended purpose, and potential health benefits. Researchers can utilize this knowledge to facilitate improved, culturally-sensitive genetic research engagement with Indigenous populations, and the findings can create increased opportunities for advancing the health of Native communities through the clinical benefits of genomics research."

Due to economic, cultural, and geographical barriers, Shipibo-Konibo women are less likely to access cervical cancer screening and therefore are at higher risk for cervical cancer mortality. Objective: to learn how cervical cancer is understood from the perspective of Shipibo-Konibo women and to see what factors influence a woman's decision to vaccinate or not vaccinate her daughter. Methodology: Thirty in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Shipibo-Konibo women from a variety of different perspectives: urban, rural, with daughters who had and had not received the vaccine. Interviews were transcribed, coded and analyzed for themes. Main results: without exception, all women in the study perceived cervical cancer as a dangerous disease and were in favor of their daughter receiving a vaccine that could protect them from cervical cancer. The main difference was: in the rural community, women had more medically accurate beliefs about the etiology of cervical cancer. In both communities, shame and poverty were identified as barriers to seeking preventive care and treatment for cervical cancer. Conclusions: These results are both encouraging, as the universal acceptability and perceived need of the HPV vaccine is high, and helpful in identifying areas of growth for future health education programs, especially surrounding risk factors for cervical cancer."

Today with the growing threats of a changing climate and continued nearshore development, important traditional resources may not be available for future generations. Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) systems are more important than ever in decision making and restoration practices as these threats increase in the Salish Sea. One example of a structure built and managed utilizing TEK is the ancient mariculture known as clam gardens: a purposely constructed rock-walled terrace that increases the habitat and productivity of traditional foods. This research aims to utilize the case study of a clam garden eco-cultural restoration in the southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada to better understand the relationship between humans and ecosystems and how focusing on those relationships offer a model for success in restoration and management. For this master’s thesis research qualitative data was obtained utilizing participant observations during restoration events and open-ended interviews with willing members of W̱SÃ NEĆ First Nations traditional knowledge working group. We found that all people involved in this project bring unique experiences, backgrounds, and motivations. We also found that this work has qualities and attributes that expand the current definition of resource active management. We identified ten qualities of the clam garden restoration work: Connections, Sharing, Work, Intergenerational, Caring for the Land, Knowledge, Alive, Engrossed, Commitment, and Food. By conducting this research utilizing Indigenous Research Principles we aim to inspire future research to obtain better data, establish better long-lasting relationships with Tribal and First Nations communities, and empower the next generation of Indigenous Scholars to conduct research for their communities."

A paradigm shift in the late 1980s increased recognition of disturbance regimes and patch dynamics as playing an important role in the ebb and flow of physical and biotic processes that generate variation in habitat conditions. A sixteen-year record of continuous habitat data provides a rare opportunity to test the Shifting Habitat Mosaic (SHM) concept, an emerging paradigm in river ecosystems where habitat patches change spatially over time in response to disturbance (e.g., flooding, erosion). I used an exceptional dataset from 65 km of a free-flowing coastal river in Elk River, OR, USA, to characterize the temporal and spatial distributions and associations between large wood, a key dominant habitat-forming feature of rivers, four fish taxa, and geomorphic features. A dynamic wood distribution and intact watershed was observed in the Elk River. A high degree of heterogeneity in wood density between adjacent reaches that varied up to 2 orders of magnitude in any year, with greater density in the tributaries and higher temporal variation in the mainstem, was observed. Wood density varied up to 3 orders of magnitude within years and among reaches. A major flood event that occurred in 1996 had a system-level effect and homogenized the spatial distribution of wood which was most apparent at finer spatial resolutions. I then tested the SHM to determine if fish-habitat relationships were maintained despite substantial changes in the spatial distribution of habitat features. This analysis revealed that three of four fish taxa were positively associated with large wood and channel depth, a dynamic and relatively static habitat feature, respectively. Results from this study point to a need for river management to maintain disturbance regimes and support aquatic-terrestrial linkages across the river corridor that characterize dynamic components of aquatic habitat. The status of climate services, including availability and usability, remains unexplored in the context of Tribal decision-making in the contiguous U.S. and Alaska. I conducted a national survey of tribal staff and environmental professionals to assess tribal use of climate services and critical barriers to tribal adaptation efforts. Survey respondents who identified as users of climate services shared that lack of staff time and funding were the greatest barriers to climate preparedness efforts of tribal organizations. Grants and workshops were identified as extremely valuable, and geographic domains important to tribal decision-making were ranked as extremely relevant. Across the user and provider community, short answer responses frequently commented on specific data needs, relationships, and capacity building, when asked about barriers to conducting climate preparedness activities and suggested improvement in the provisioning of climate services. As the impacts of climate change become more pronounced and disproportionately affect tribal and Indigenous communities, this study provides a first landscape view of the usability and effectiveness of climate services used by staff of tribal and non-tribal entities and can be used to refine climate services produced by the science community."

Although little is known about QTPI health disparities, the “Indigenist” Stress and Coping Model suggests that cultural determinants of health could be utilized to promote QTPI Health. Although interventions utilizing these determinants exist and demonstrate efficacy, the mechanisms by which they can improve QTPI health have yet to be explored. Methods Using semi-structured qualitative interviews and Community Based Participatory research principles, the study aimed to examine: the health issues experienced by QTPI community, ways to collect health information from QTPI populations, and identify mechanisms by which culturally-rooted health interventions can produce better health for QTPI people. 12 interviews were conducted with Queer and Transgender Pacific Islander adults who spoke English. Data collection was constrained by COVID-19 and more data is needed to achieve inductive thematic and data saturation. Common and unique themes were identified in relation to QTPI’s health experiences. Results QTPI views of their health were related to harmonious relationships between their mind, body, and spirit that were shaped by cultural and social norms. Cultural responsiveness, and a simultaneous understanding of QTPI’s culture; gender; and sexuality, creates comfort and greater ability to talk about their health with providers. Agofli’e and alofa (“Visibility and Love”) were identified as important cultural mechanisms to improve QTPI mental health and the relationship between their mind, body, and spirit. Conclusions Culture is critical to understanding and improving QTPI Health. Providers should consider utilizing culturally responsive practices when discussing health with QTPI. Pacific cultural values that embody visibility and love for QTPI should be included in future models and culturally rooted health interventions that seek to improve QTPI health."

UHC entails both ensuring financial protection from health expenditures and providing access to quality services. Beginning in 2011, eight Mesoamerican countries joined the Salud Mesoamérica Initiative (SMI), a results-based aid (RBA) program aiming to reduce maternal and child health disparities. Countries and SMI donors negotiated financially incentivized targets for improving process and outcome measures in marginalized regions. Integral to SMI is an independent evaluation, involving thousands of health facility and household surveys over several years, used for this dissertation. It first assesses baseline levels of financial protection in SMI target populations of six countries, finding high levels of out-of-pocket payments (particularly on prescription drugs) and over 20% of households forgoing care due to cost. Next, it evaluates the impact of SMI’s first two phases on financial protection in four countries, finding significant improvements in Honduras (mediated by use of the public over private sector and less self-reported illness), but null or mixed results elsewhere. Finally, it evaluates SMI’s impact on prenatal care in Honduras, finding that SMI improved the timing and quality of care recorded in medical records, but not according to women’s own recall. Collectively, these findings give early indications that SMI RBA model improved select UHC indicators in certain settings, but not others. It implores the need for quantitative and qualitative work to evaluate if SMI can achieve population-level health improvements and understand the contextual factors leading to success in some settings and failure in others."

How this Native territory can be described in Indian terms and extricated from the interiority of European terms has been the main concern of this translation of the Codex.The Oklahoma Codex exists as both a museum object of 19th century Oklahoma, and as a product of European historiographical tradition. As part of a museum collection, the Codex resides at a place that claims intellectual and physical ownership of the material evidence of Native history. These objects are external to the invasions that confiscated them and so they conceal that indigenous American material and intellectual culture has been displaced to European discourse. But the Codex's link to Torquemada recontextualizes the narrative of kings in Oklahoma and opens up the diachronic text of the Conquest of America and the centrality of Spanish matters in discourses that continually inscribe Indian text.Although similar in content, the Monarquia and the Codex interpellate the reader in different ways. Whereas the Codex asks the reader to respond from the place of Nahuatl eytmology, the comparative added text of the Monarquia interpellates her at the site of morality, the concern of Lawrence Venuti in The Scandals of Translation.

Such programs are considered within the context of wider United States Indian policy as it developed out of late nineteenth and early twentieth century efforts to reform government policy regarding Native Americans. Additionally, it locates those features of government programs of the 1930s and early 1940s that built upon earlier privately sponsored efforts to promote the welfare of America's indigenous peoples.Touted as exemplary of a new and enlightened United States Indian policy intended to remedy and reverse previously misguided assimilationist government policy, federally funded Indian arts and crafts programs of the 1930s and early 1940s were intended to restore Native cultural practices for the benefit of Native peoples. However well-intended and sincerely motivated by a desire to revive traditional cultures they may have been, these efforts by middle-class and affluent white citizens fell far short of their ultimate expressed goal. It is my assertion that such programs ultimately worked to position indigenous artisans and their work as ""natural"" resources, as the raw materials necessary to a process of colonial domination productive of enormous cultural capital for Euro-Americans. Such arts and crafts ""revival"" efforts, I contend, served to more firmly position Native North Americans as exploited colonial subjects, ultimately working at cross-purposes with reformers' expressed intent to foster greater self-sufficiency and self-direction among such indigenous peoples.In the 1930s and early 1940s, the federal government researched and recorded traditional forms of native production and, in many cases, completely retaught them the descendants of their original practitioners in an effort to stimulate production of arts and crafts forms amenable to Euro-American ends. This dissertation explores both the immediate and long-range effects of federally funded Indian arts and crafts programs through an examination of their historical base and through an analysis of the discursive structures that functioned to support them. It also attempts to locate points of resistance that allowed native producers some modicum of agency in a situation of colonial dominance."

In Seattle, however, urban history and Indian history have always existed in dialogue with each other. ""The Crossing-Over Place"" brings these two histories together, examining the experiences of Native people in an urban place and the meanings of Indians---both real and imagined---in civic life.Beginning with imperial and epidemiological incursions into the dynamic indigenous landscape, ""The Crossing-Over Place"" argues that Native people and places were central to urban founding, which happened not in a singular moment but over a period of decades. On the urban indigenous frontier of the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s, Indians were central to town life---as laborers, as neighbors and kin, as symbols of disorder---and this mixed-race reality confounded both civic leaders' ambitions and federal Indian policy. As late as 1880, Seattle was still a Native place.Between 1880 and the 1930s, Seattle became a metropolis. Despite massive transformations of the urban landscape, some indigenous people found ways to survive in this changed world, while their descendants maintained ties to the city from area reservations. Meanwhile, the movements of Native people and objects in Seattle's regional hinterland inspired new identities for the migrants and the city itself. And as boosters and historians tried to explain Seattle's past, they told stories about Indians---as enemies, as caricatures, and as symbols of a lost wilderness. By 1940, Native people were often invisible in a city that used Indian images to understand itself.After World War II, urban changes led to new kinds of authority for Native people. Pan-Indian activists mobilized in an increasingly multicultural political landscape to claim spaces in the city, and downtown gentrification destroyed a Native Skid Road neighborhood but also inspired powerful narratives of urban dispossession. Meanwhile, local tribes capitalized on urban environmentalism to find new authority over urban places and narratives. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Indians of several kinds had returned to the center of civic life, even if many questions about the nature and meaning of urban conquest remained unresolved."

Three primary concerns drive this work: first, to study how multiple colonial situations in California created both limitations on and possibilities for Indigenous survivance and creative expressions of identity; second, to refute the pernicious assumption that there is no such thing as California Native literatures; and third, to amplify the many twentieth and twenty-first century California Native voices that have labored toward political, cultural, and creative sovereignty for their tribal nations. Following these concerns leads to evocative possibilities for understanding the role that California Native literary and artistic production plays in reimagining California histories, lands, and waters."

people being disproportionately impacted. Racial and ethnic disparities in MM and SMM are not completely explained by social, economic, and behavioral factors suggesting that the impact of racism should be further explored as a driving factor of MM and SMM. Healthcare visits during the postpartum period, a period during which a significant proportion of pregnancy-related complications occur, provide an opportunity for interventions to prevent MM and SMM. The primary aim of this study was to quantify the association between experiencing racism within the 12 months before delivery and postpartum follow-up visit attendance. The secondary aim of this study was to examine if this association varies by racial and ethnic subgroups. Methods: This research study was a cross-sectional secondary analysis of 2019 data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). PRAMS is coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study sample included a total of
676,047 participants with 47,832 pregnant people experiencing racism and 628,215 pregnant people not experiencing racism. The outcome was not attending a postpartum follow-up visit within 4-6 weeks of giving birth. Three logistic regression models were used to calculate
prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals. The first regression model was the crude, unadjusted model. The second regression model adjusted for demographic factors, and the third regression model adjusted for demographic factors and pregnancy complications. To
address the secondary aim, the three regression models were run within each racial and ethnic subgroup. Results: About 47,832 (7%) of participants experienced racism. The prevalence of postpartum nonattendance was 11% among participants who did experience racism, and 6.7% among
participants who did not experience racism. In unadjusted and partially adjusted models, not attending postpartum follow-up visits were 67% (95% CI: 0.95, 2.92) and 51% (95% CI: 0.66,
3.48) higher among pregnant participants who did experience racism in comparison to pregnant participants who did not experience racism. However, both associations were not statistically
significant. In fully adjusted models, associations were further attenuated, and postpartum
nonattendance was statistically insignificant 28% (95% CI: 0.07, 5.26) higher among
participants who experienced racism compared to those who did not. After adjusting for
demographic factors and complicated pregnancies, although statistically insignificant, we
observed stronger associations among Black and Indigenous pregnant participants, where
postpartum nonattendance among Black pregnant participants who experienced racism was
87% and postpartum nonattendance among Indigenous pregnant participants was 92% higher
compared to the respective referent groups of pregnant participants who did not experience
racism. Conclusion: In conclusion, we found that people who experienced racism may have a higher prevalence of postpartum follow-up nonattendance, although the associations were not
statistically significant. The results from this study are consistent with previous reports from
quantitative and qualitative studies. We also found that this association may be stronger among
Black and Indigenous pregnant participants in comparison to White Non-Hispanic pregnant
participants. The results from this study highlight the need for further exploration of the impacts
of pregnant people experiencing racism and other pregnancy outcomes. The field of public
health must research and address these impacts to promote the health of historically excluded
groups, improve health equity, and protect the quality of life of birthing people and their new
infants."

The primary focus of study is the interaction between Native and European peoples. This is a study about empire and colonization in the Great Lakes and interior west of North America. It is also an attempt to place Native peoples at the center of a narrative about the historical development of the continent. This dissertation argues that the western interior remained indigenous and autonomous until the late 19th century, in spite of European and Euro-American claims of possession and sovereignty. It further contends that the Native peoples who migrated between the indigenous west and the colonial east significantly influenced the process of colonization in Canada and the Great Lakes, and significantly impacted the development of social structures and categories in the larger Atlantic World. In this story Native peoples do not lose themselves in a New World that is not of their own making. Rather, they are at the heart of a continental process of transformation that determined meaning race, nation, and citizenship in modern North America."

In the past fifteen years, this kind of collaborative theatre has emerged as part of an overall consciousness-raising among indigenous peoples in Mexico, and represents a non-violent response to the same kinds of pressures that have provoked armed responses among the Zapatistas and the more recently formed Army of Popular Revolution. That is, within the microcosm of their own organizations, these troupes seek a brand of creative autonomy that does not equal marginalization from the non-indigenous world, and a kind of collaboration with that world that does not equal complete assimilation to it.Issues of intercultural collaboration become complicated in Mayan communities by ongoing gender inequities within them. In an effort to preserve and valorize Mayan traditions in the face of increasing cultural and economic globalization, many communities (and the theatre troupes that emerge from them) reproduce oppressive gender relationships in the name of ""tradition"" and ""customary law."" Thus, gender is employed as a metaphorical and analytical category to test the limits of both ethnicity and hybridity in various models of intercultural exchange."

response to oil exploitation activities in the Peruvian Amazon. This study is based on a
political ecology analysis and a review of existing literature on local and global relations
of environmental issues. The Corrientes River case reveals how Amazonian indigenous
people gained competence to demand recognition of their collective rights to health and
citizenship. The Achuar people's mobilization was a result of frustration of sterile
dialogue with the authorities, the oil companies, and the pressure exerted by local people on their leaders. This mobilization resulted in an agreement that otherwise would likely

an introduction to Native American life and the impacts of Spanish, Mexican, and
""American"" colonization on the state's indigenous people. Teachers in the state use
museums to supplement this education. Natural history and anthropology museums offer
programs for teaching third graders about native pre-contact life, while Missions and
regional history museums are charged with telling the story of settlement for the state's
fourth graders. Clearly, this fact suggests the centrality of museums and Missions to
education in the state.
Since only one small tribe on the central coast has federal recognition, non-tribal
museums are the only public voice about Indian life. These sites however, rarely address hardships experienced by native people, contributions over the past 150 years, the
struggles for sovereignty in their homelands, and a variety of other issues faced by living
Indian people. Instead, these sites often portray essentialized homogenous notions of
Indiamless which inadvertently contribute to the invisibility of coastal Native peoples.
This dissertation analyzes visual museum representations in central coast museums and
Missions and the perspectives oflocal Native American community members about how
their lives and cultures are portrayed in those museums.
Using methods of critical discourse analysis, the dissertation seeks to locate
discontinuities between the stories museums tell versus the stories Indian people tell. It
addresses these ruptures through a detailed analysis of alternative narratives and then
offers suggestions to museum professionals, both in California and elsewhere, for
incorporating a stronger native voice in interpretive efforts."

The permanent Grand Ronde Reservation, settled in 1855 and established by presidential executive order in 1857, was terminated by Congress, and the tribal people lost their Federal recognition. The seven ratified treaties that ceded to the United States millions of acres of land, most of western Oregon, which was occupied by over 60 tribal nations, were nullified. These 60 tribes were declared by Congress to be assimilated, and termination was enacted to free them from continued government management and oppression.

In western Oregon, native people appeared to cease to exist, and for 29 years the Grand Ronde descendants suffered disenfranchisement and a multitude of social problems. The reservation's tribal cultures, languages, and community were severely fractured and much was lost. Terminated tribal members were rejected by other tribes as having willingly sold out to the Federal government. During the post-termination era, despite all of the problems the tribal members faced, they found ways to survive and worked to restore the tribe. In 1983, the Grand Ronde Tribe was restored.

This research gathers disparate information from political, anthropological, historical, and tribal sources to analyze and understand the termination of the Grand Ronde Reservation. Revealed are the many political issues of the 1940s and 1950s that contributed to termination. Oral histories and government correspondence and reports from the era are referenced to illuminate the reality of tribal life in the post-termination era.

The research connects to historic strategies of the Federal government to colonize all aboriginal lands and to assimilate Indians. Finally, this study seeks to unveil the history of the Grand Ronde Reservation and its peoples so that the tribal people may understand and recover from the effects of the termination of the tribe. The continued effects of termination are explored, discussed, and connected to issues of tribal identity and indigenous decolonization."

acclaimed artist within a new context: that of his purposeful use of cultural hybridity as a
vehicle to explore his own postcolonial identity.
My thesis locates this aspect of Bartow's work within a larger critical examination
of how a mix of Native and non-Native iconography is used by some artists of American
Indian descent to critique the status and reception of indigenous art in the context of
Western art history. Bartow's on-going collaboration with Japanese Master Printer Seiichi
Hiroshima exemplifies how Bartow's innovative use of the signs and symbols of other
cultures endeavors to shift the language used to discuss American Indian art."

This project addresses the related questions: In what ways does environmentalism--as a code of behavioral imperatives and as a set of rhetorical strategies--ironically play a role in the exploitation of land and communities? Along what lines--class, race, ability, gender, nationality, age, and even ""sense of place""--do these environmental codes and discourses delineate good and bad environmental behavior?

I contend that environmentalism emerged in part to help legitimize U.S. imperial ambitions and support racialized and patriarchal conceptions of national identity. Concern about ""the environment"" made anxieties about communities of color more palatable than overt racism. Furthermore, ""environmentalism's hidden attachments"" to whiteness and Manifest Destiny historically aligned the movement with other repressive ideologies, such as eugenics and strict anti-immigration. These ""hidden attachments"" exist today, yet few have analyzed their contemporary implications, a gap this project fills.

In three chapters, I detail nineteenth-century environmentalism's influence on contemporary environmental thought. Each of these three illustrative chapters investigates a distinct category of environmentalism's ""ecological others"": Native Americans, people with disabilities, and undocumented immigrants. I argue that environmentalism defines these groups as ""ecological others"" because they are viewed as threats to nature and to the American national body politic. The first illustrative chapter analyzes Native American land claims in Leslie Marmon Silko's 1991 novel, Almanac of the Dead . The second illustrative chapter examines the importance of the fit body in environmental literature and U.S. adventure culture. In the third illustrative chapter, I integrate literary analysis with geographical theories and methods to investigate national security, wilderness protection, and undocumented immigration in the borderland. In a concluding fourth chapter, I analyze works of members of the excluded groups discussed in the first three chapters to show how they transform mainstream environmentalism to bridge social justice and ecological concerns.

The study investigates the functions and values of legal/regulatory and economic linguistic resources that travel through time and space, linking Kake to other sites, regional, national, and international. In light of increasing environmental issues world wide, the study examines how legal and regulatory processes influence beliefs about community and environment as a whole. Within the dissertation are case studies to show how local, day-to-day, community and environment-related narratives interact with state discourses. The study asks how words and stories in everyday conversations express and interpret the extent to which local Kake people feel emotion and responsibility for their forest and marine environment and each other. In addition, the study asks how people communicate their narratives about place, community, and work to government representatives, who converse using their own specialized language, narrative, and discourse rules. How, in turn, do local groups interpret and react to law-making and regulatory narratives? In the context of social attributes that help communities focus on sustainable livelihood strategies and the importance of environmental integrity, the study assesses what types of information get left out of discourses between local island people and state representatives. Communicating with official government agency personnel in public hearings, through documents, and in reaction to state decisions, influences changes in local words, stories and perceptions about people and place. The discursive and ideological adjustments that result can enhance or detract from local narratives that socialize moral codes and attachment to community and environment."

This study explores how a proactive, community-based approach to wildland fire management can provide tribes with
opportunities to pursue economic and cultural development activities. Findings suggest that opportunities exist for employment, small business development, and cultural enhancement projects through wildland fire management. Tribes face several obstacles to pursuing such opportunities including a lack of financial, political, and human capital. Building workforce capacity, forming strategic partnerships, educating tribal leadership, and exercising tribal sovereignty are key to creating economic opportunity through wildland fire management."

The evolution of Polynesia's complex chiefly systems is a long standing issue in anthropology, and prior archaeological research has identified that specialized goods were a significant factor in the elevation of elite status in many Polynesian contexts. Before Western contact, Samoa was a stratified chiefdom with leaders claiming exclusive privileges and participating in an extensive trade network within the Fiji-West Polynesian region during the Traditional Samoan period (c. A.D. 300-1700). However, Samoa's political structure was quite different in the earlier Polynesian Plainware period (c. 500 B.C.-A.D. 300). Archaeologists, with the aid of historical linguistics, have documented a simple hereditary system operating among small horticultural communities. To address this political transformation, I investigate coeval changes occurring in stone adze production recovered on Tutuila Island.

Based firmly in the theoretical perspective of political economy, I ask three inter-related questions in my dissertation: were adze specialists present in ancient Samoa; if so, what was their connection to chiefly prerogatives; and what further relationship did these adze producers have with Samoa's emerging elite? To answer these questions, I utilize mass flake analysis and typological classifications to document technological and spatial changes in stone tool production. I also employ settlement studies and geochemical characterization to chart how leaders managed and controlled raw materials, as well as the distribution of basalt adzes in exchange networks.

From my research, I record numerous nucleated workshops of adze specialization on Tutuila dating as far back as 800 years ago. As a new form of economic organization, these adze specialists acted as catalysts for increased political complexity and stratified authority. In addition, I trace how Samoan elites used their bourgeoning authority in restricting access to basalt sources and the distribution of the finished products during this same time period. In the larger Samoan political economy, I conclude that Tutuilan chiefs, located in an otherwise economically-impoverished island, utilized these newly-developed adze specialists and high-quality basalt as strategic resources for accumulating material surplus in prestige competition."

archaeological profession, is silent as to the view of Gosiute and Shoshone natives about
their own ancestors. The goal of this dissertation is the infusion of Punown (interrelated
Numic speaking peoples) epistemology into mainstream anthropological interpretation, as
provided through North American Desert West prehistory. The hypothesized Numic
expansion into the Northeast Great Basin, according to which the Punown natives now
resident throughout the region are very recent immigrants, is problematic on several
grounds. In the dissertation I show that late population movement into this region by
Numic ancestors has not been demonstrated. After a hundred years of research no
consensus yet exists as to the origins of the Northern Uto-Aztecan speaking Numic peoples
(Punown). In spite of that, and in spite of the fact that it takes no account of the natives'
own view of their origins, the Numic Expansion Hypothesis is being used in a way by some archaeologists and cultural resource managers that denies to the Punown their
cultural heritage. The archaeological record of the region, extending back into deep time, is
rich in the similarities it shows with the native Punown cultures of the contact-historic
period. The epistemology and spiritual beliefs of the Punown also assert their cultural
continuity with the ancient traditions documented in that archaeological recoret;It is not
acceptable that a scientific hypothesis impedes native people's role in the care and
stewardship of sites and places throughout the region that their own spiritual traditions tell
them they are responsible for.
The mainstream anthropological concept of science and the epistemology of the
Punown are opposed diametrically. Punown view the world and its people as
interconnected through the Sacred Earth Matrix, while anthropologists see the human
world as bifurcated from nature. Punown understand archaeology and relatedness
spiritually, while archaeologists see dead objects in an ""objectified"" way. Conformity to the
existing paradigm, with its persistent building and rebuilding of earlier untenable
Euroamerican views of Numic origins, makes the Punown outsiders to the region in which
they live. This goes on even though many scholars, reviewing the case for a Numic
Expansion, find it seriously lacking. Infusion of Punown epistemology into current
archaeological practice offers a basis for pooling Punown and mainstream anthropological
approaches to the prehistory of the Desert West. A mutually enhancing research partnership
based on beneficial objectives is advocated; this will go far to repair a strained relationship
that now exists between Punown and archaeological researchers, and result in a fuller and
richer history for all to contemplate."

early nineteenth-century Americas. I focus primarily on Joel Roberts Poinsett, a United

During his diplomatic service in Chile in the 1810s and Mexico in the 1820s, I argue that Poinsett distinguished the character of the United States from that of European empires by actively fostering republican culture and institutions, while also pursuing an increasingly aggressive program of national self-interest. The imperial nature of Poinsett's ideology became pronounced as he pursued the annexation of Texas and the removal of the Cherokee Indians, requiring him to construct an
exclusionary and racialized understanding of American republicanism."

This dissertation examines the epistemological complexities that teaching Indigenous identity, cultural teachings, and futurities are met with in mainstream classrooms. In the early chapters, I spend time describing what I mean by using the phrase Indigenous commonsense. The core of this idea is that teaching and learning only occurs in relation to others, otherwise it has no context, and without context it has no meaning or significance. Learning in a good way requires ensuring the health of those relationships (Merculieff & Roderick, 2013; Wilson, 2008). However, even the most well-intentioned educators who do provide Indigenous standpoints in their teaching (authors, invited guest, contemporary perspectives) seldom account for how the processes through which Western epistemology filter and constrain how Indigenous people and teachings can be “known” by learners. In this study I was compelled to provide an analysis’ for how challenging teaching Indigenous topics are when attempting to be answerable to the goal of unsettling the influences of colonialism. To do this, I offered stories of classroom experiences shared by Indigenous educators.
In chapter IV I looked at what some basic inclusion of Indigenous perspectives would mean in a middle school English Language Arts curriculum. This chapter analyzes the ways in which curriculum can be answerable to interrupting the multiple colonial epistemic maneuvers that attempt to confine Indigenous people’s identities and cultural memories. In chapter V I examined the process for how, in many cases, Indigenous epistemologies come to be “known” through Western epistemological reading habits. This research was prompted by an interview with an Indigenous educator who shared the story of their experience of reading Indigenous philosophical texts in a graduate course with majority non-Native students. The primary purpose of this analysis was to invite educators to contemplate, through the acts of remembering or forgetting, who’s or what futurity their chosen curriculum and teaching method is manifesting."

Science is completely entwined in the culture, art, languages, and everyday lives of Indigenous peoples; therefore it is not a discreet knowledge or entity. A narrative of failure is being produced that falsely portrays Indigenous students as ‘underperforming’, not ‘good at’ science, and that perpetuates the perception of an achievement gap. However, the real problem is the way we look at, think about, consider, and teach science in US public schools, particularly for Indigenous students. Curriculum and pedagogy that present science education out of cultural context is problematic. Indigenous students need to learn science in Indigenous ways, and then the in western paradigm.

In this study I employed a qualitative design, consisting of interviews and observations with students and their instructors. I conducted a semi-structured interview with each participant, then, based on an initial analysis, chose three students for in-depth case studies. I attended a number of science courses with the students and faculty, and conducted interviews with two main faculty members. I presented my initial analysis and invited my participants to give further feedback.

There are possibilities for doing decolonizing work within the academy. We need more Indigenous folx as professors, and we need non-Indigenous faculty to apply decolonizing and indigenizing curriculum, pedagogies, and practices. Examples of this can include bringing students together with Elders and other tribal experts, employing place-based educational practices, intergenerational learning, learning through story, and oral traditions. Supporting community and reciprocity is also important for our Indigenous students. Faculty face tensions in doing good work with and for their Indigenous students, including the challenge of how to adequately address the field’s expectation of students while still being responsive to student needs. Instructors also talked about balancing their connection to students with maintaining appropriate boundaries, and one instructor shared insight regarding gender differences and imbalances. These instructors voiced the desire and need to enhance their teaching skills and requested training in how to teach effectively and in a caring way for their specific communities."

This dissertation approaches Indigenous environmental justice through a trans/national, tribally specific framework, examining contemporary Dakota and Ojibwe texts and offering an intervention into ecocriticism, which often falls short in its engagements with Indigenous literatures. The first chapter explores a genealogy of relationality in Dakota and Ojibwe literary theory and examines the role of nationhood in Indigenous literary studies. The second chapter examines Elizabeth Cook-Lynn’s Aurelia trilogy through a framework of social vulnerability and historical trauma. The third chapter studies Waubgeshig Rice’s speculative novel Moon of the Crusted Snow, further exploring social vulnerability and resilience through the genres of apocalyptic literature and Indigenous futurisms. The third chapter approaches Winona LaDuke’s Last Standing Woman and Vine Deloria Jr.’s God is Red through a discussion of spiritual revitalization, repatriation of Indigenous remains, and resurgence. The conclusion examines the NoDAPL movement via John Trudell’s poem “Crazy Horse,” connecting these threads of relationality, vulnerability, resistance, and resurgence in the context of a recent environmental justice movement. The coda looks outward to the ongoing public lands discussion, considering how centering Indigenous relations to land can contribute to that conversation."

This assessment utilized Tuck et al.’s (2014) land education theoretical framework to provide the lens with which to structure questions and analysis. I argue that where a CTUIR community members falls along a spectrum of closeness in relationships with land and community is the highest indicator not only of their current relationship with First Foods but also the education and outreach opportunities they are drawn to. I conclude that First Food knowledge transmission practices would benefit from additional attention given to 1) the definition of First Foods and 2) further understanding of inclusion or exclusion among CTUIR community members."

Through ethnographic research with Zapotec media producers in Oaxaca and the supportive organizations forming points of connection between radios and activists, I argue that the strength of the indigenous community media movement in Oaxaca, and its potential to build a movement to resist destructive state and market forces, is best explained by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s concept of the rhizome, which portrays Oaxacan indigenous media as a map of heterogeneous interconnections defying structural hierarchies and binaries. With this picture of a rhizomatic media movement, I demonstrate how radios have paved the way for innovations, revealing creative ways that indigenous groups are connecting with each other and the outside world, while asserting agency in their interactions with the market and the state."

For example, laws require a portion of mining profits to be invested in the modernization and development of populated areas near extractive sites. Mining investments are used to persuade populations to agree to extractive activities and are utilized as a strategy to modernize rural/indigenous ways of life. Thus, state intervention and mining, and oil activity expansion affect the local ability to respond to changes taking place at a rapid pace while also causing a number of conflicts.

I use case studies of communities facing encroachment of mining in the Amazon of Ecuador to better understand: a) the ways in which affected people struggle to maintain control over territories, b) the ways in which people adapt and respond to the negative effects of state and oil expansion and c) the ways in which indigenous people understand and cope with conflicts and violence produced by mining and oil industry.

My findings show first that indigenous and peasant communities require access to ‘volumetric knowledge’ in order to increase their ability to participate in processes of negotiation with the state. These processes define access to land and redistribution of oil extraction profits. Volumetric knowledge makes reference to understandings of oil volume, quality, infrastructure and environmental impacts in affected territories. Second, my findings show that communities affected by oil extraction respond ambivalently when adapting livelihood strategies to the expansion of oil extraction and increased state presence. Specifically, people partially reject and embrace state-imposed development and modernization programs. I focus on the process that informs families’ decision-making process, suggesting that ‘tactical subjectivity’ informs livelihood strategies at the household level. Third, state modernization and development programs reinforce colonial power dynamics in the Amazon; thus, ‘epistemic violence’ takes place as indigenous traditional knowledge that makes sense of conflicts and violence is undermined and erased by western logic driven by state-led modernization and development."

Looking specifically at Tribal History/Shared History curriculum in Oregon, this research highlights the importance of incorporating Culturally Sustaining curriculum in addressing narratives that perpetuate harm and erase Native histories and current lifeways in schools. After a review on current and foundational literature on healing and Native American curriculum throughout what is now known as the United States, this study emphasizes how Native studies curriculum can foster a resurgence of Indigenous knowledges. To examine the healing potential of TH/SH curriculum, the author turns to the self-developed theoretical framework, Stinta (Love) as Theory, which is informed by Indigenous and Chicana feminist theories, including felt theory and cultural intuition. Through a series of Sharing Circles with Indigenous educators, and a process of Collaborative Storying, this research centers Indigenous Methodologies of storytelling to showcase how this curriculum can actively promote healing and Indigenous joy. Including Native perspectives in school curricula isn’t just about telling the truth about history, it is about creating a space for healing and empowerment for students, educators, and Tribal communities. By involving Native educators directly in curriculum implementation, research, and professional development, this research shows that accurate Native American curricula can offer a path to healing and resilience, if it is fully embraced and implemented across the state. Moreover, through stories of Native teachers implementing the TH/SH curriculum and the wealth of knowledge and lived experience they bring to their classrooms, this study highlights the importance of Native teachers and Native teacher preparation programs."

In the case of the researcher's family, the educational experiences at Carlisle Indian Industrial School immediately started a traumatic assimilation process on Indigenous children that instilled generational trauma for them and their descendants. At these schools, Indigenous children were forced to conform to a foreign European school designed to abolish their Indigenous identity that demanded they give up their language and culture to be successful in education. In this study, the researcher explored the history of settler colonialism within Indian boarding schools and its impact on the succeeding generations of students who first attended them. Through in-depth interviewing method, 16 participants shared their family stories and perceptions of how Indian boarding schools were unwelcoming places of learning, where Indigenous children were forced to engage in an education system that had at its core, settler colonialism within its curriculum. The findings revealed how the student's Indigenous identity became a factor in the student's survival within the schools and was paramount in building the children's resilience while undergoing assimilation into the White European immigrant society.

The radical movements at the beginning of the 21st century against neoliberalism that paved the road for the election of Bolivia's first indigenous president, Evo Morales, beckoned a change from colonial rule towards a more just society. Paradoxically, in pursuing progress through economic growth, the Bolivian state led by President Morales has replicated the colonial division of labor through a development model known as neo-extractivism. Deeply rooted tensions have also emerged between indigenous communities and the Bolivian state due to the latter's zealous economic bond with the extractivist sector.

Although these paradoxes have received significant attention, one substantial aspect that remains underexplored and undertheorized is how such tensions affect socio-political relations at the intersections of class, race and gender where indigenous women in Bolivia occupy a unique position. To address this research gap, this qualitative study poses the following research questions: 1. How does neo-extractivism affect the lives of indigenous women? 2. How does the state shape relations between neo-extractivism and indigenous women? 3. How do indigenous women organize to challenge the impact of state-led extractivism on their lives and their communities? To answer these questions, I conducted a multi-sited ethnographic study between October 2017 and June 2018 in Oruro, Bolivia, an area that is heavily affected by mining contamination. By analyzing processes of social reproduction, I argue that neo-extractivism leads to water contamination and water scarcity, becoming the epicenter of the deterioration of subsistence agriculture and the dispossession of indigenous ways of life. Because indigenous women are subsistence producers and social reproducers whose activities depend on water, the dispossession of water has a dire effect on them, which demonstrates how capitalism relies on and exacerbates neo-colonial and patriarchal relations.

To tame dissent to these contradictions, the Bolivian and self-proclaimed ""indigenist state"" defines and politicizes ethnicity in order to build a national identity based on indigeneity. This state-led ethnic inclusion, however, simultaneously produces class exclusions of indigenous campesinxs (peasants) who are not fully engaged in market relations. In contrast to the government's inclusive but rigidly-defined indigeneity, indigenous communities embrace a fluid and dual indigeneity: one that is connected to territories, yet also independent from them; a rooted indigeneity based on the praxis of what it means to be indigenous. Indigenous women and their communities embrace this fluid and rooted indigeneity to build alliances across gender, ethnic, and geographic lines to organize against neo-extractivism. Moreover, the daily responsibilities of social reproduction within the context of subsistence agriculture, which are embedded in Andean epistemes of reciprocity, duality, and complementarity, have allowed indigenous women to build solidarity networks that keep the social fabric within, and between, communities alive. These solidarity networks are sites of everyday resistances that represent a threat and an alternative to capitalist, colonial and patriarchal mandates."

In the negotiation of treaties between the United States, nearly one hundred years earlier, Indigenous leaders reserved access to Columbia River fishing sites as they ceded territory and retained smaller reservations. In the years before the dam's completion, leaders, many of who were the descendants of earlier treaty signatories, attempted to stop the dam and protect both fishing sites from the encroachment of state and federal regulations and archaeological sites from destruction. This study traces the work of Wilson Charley, a Native fisherman, a member of the Yakama Nation's Tribal Council, and great-grandson of one of the 1855 treaty signatories. More broadly, this study places Indigenous actors on a twentieth-century Columbia River while demonstrating that they played active roles in the protest and management of areas affected by The Dalles Dam.

Using previously untapped archival sources--a substantial cache of letters--my analysis illustrates that Charley articulated multiple strategies to fight The Dalles Dam and regulations to curtail Native's treaty fishing rights. Aiming to protect the 1855 treaty and stop The Dalles Dam, Charley created Native-centered regulatory agencies. He worked directly with politicians and supported political candidates, like Richard Neuberger, that favored Native concerns. He attempted to build partnerships with archaeologists and landscape preservationists concerned about losing the area's rich cultural sites. Even after the dam's completion, he conceptualized multiple tribal economic development plans that would allow for Natives' cultural and economic survival.

Given the national rise of technological optimism and the willingness for the federal government to terminate its relationship with federally recognized tribes, Charley realized that taking the 1855 treaty to court was too risky for the political climate of the 1950s. Instead, he framed his strategies in the language of twentieth-century conservation, specifically to garner support from a national audience of non-natives interested in protecting landscapes from industrial development. While many of these non-native partners ultimately failed him, his strategies are noteworthy for three reasons. First, he cast the fight to uphold Native treaty rights in terms that were relevant to non-natives, demonstrating his complex understanding of the times in which he lived. Second, his strategies continued an ongoing struggle for Natives to fish at their treaty-protected sites, thereby documenting an overlooked period between the fishing rights cases of the turn of the twentieth century and the 1960s and 1970s. Charley left a lasting legacy that scholars have not recognized because many of his visionary ideas came to fruition decades later. Finally, my analysis of Charley's letters also documents personal details that afford readers the unique perspective of one Indigenous person navigated through a tumultuous period in the Pacific Northwest and Native American history."

At the outset, the project was advocated and led by the tribal leadership of the Isle de Jean Charles Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe. Although, through the course of the resettlement the supposed partnership between the State of Louisiana and the Tribe has dissolved. This study seeks to provide a robust and in-depth understanding of the planning and implementation process of the IDJC resettlement to inform future climate relocations.

To interrogate the power dynamics and motivations of different actors, I employed a multiple-methods approach involving discourse and content analysis to examine the policy, cartographic, and media narratives of place and their material implications for the resettlement plans, process, and possible future outcomes. I present a three-part theoretical framework that incorporates Indigenized Environmental Justice, sense of place theory, and critical cartography to interrogate rootedness, power, and the construction of place on Isle de Jean Charles and in the resettlement community, the New Isle.

I found that while the State of Louisiana uses multiple forms of outreach and engagement within the planning process of the IDJC resettlement, this ultimately leads to the erasure of the Tribal community through multiple layers of injustice. The findings revealed several key differences in the discourse between the state and tribal resettlement policies including the goals around a 'holistic' resettlement, the roles of water and wetlands, and the definitions of key words such as 'community' and 'stakeholder'. These narratives were further made real through topographic maps and the media articles which presented two contested narratives of place--an Indigenous perspective and a settler colonial understanding. Ultimately, it was the State of Louisiana, not the Tribe, who exerted greater power in the shaping of the resettlement plans and processes to fit their constructed meanings of place. In this way, the IDJC resettlement is a model of resettlement which reinforced settler colonial practices and perpetuated environmental injustices on the Isle de Jean Charles Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe.

I call for deeper scrutiny of the language and discourses used within community resettlement plans in the future. In order to address previous (and current) harms due to displacement, I make further recommendations to amend the relationship between the US and Tribal communities in ways which fosters Indigenous sovereignty and Indigenized environmental justice. Finally, I propose the reconceptualization of resettlement as an opportunity for regeneration as 'site expansion' and not site abandonment."

In El pez de oro, Gamaliel Churata presents a strategy for the recuperation of native Andean cultural agency that enables the Andean subject to reclaim traces of their ancestral past under more verisimilar and verifiable terms. Churata argues that through a recuperation of native language and its infusion into the body of the major colonial language, Spanish, the Andean subject is equipped with a new culture producing tool that enables the recuperation of language, agency, history, and, ultimately, representation and inclusion within cultural and political institutional frameworks. By introducing his own function of bilingualism, vernacular language, and mythological infusions into the body of colonial letters, Gamaliel Churata is able to destabilize and disrupt colonial historical and textual authority to the point where the invented concept of America and the colonial product of American identity can be re-examined. Through this examination emerges a new option for the categorization of American identity as an aesthetic construct. Within this new categorization of aesthetic American identity, the Andean subject can begin his own process of self-identification through his native language toward the production of a future Andean American subject.

As the evidence mounts and more people awaken to this reality, increased attention is being dedicated to the pursuit of answers for a just and sustainable future. This dissertation grew from the premise that effectively moving towards sustainability requires change at all levels of the dominant Western culture, including deeply held worldviews. The worldviews of many indigenous cultures offer alternative values and beliefs that can contribute to addressing the root causes of problems related to sustainability. In the bioregion defined by the Pacific Salmon runs of North America there is a rich heritage and modern day presence of diverse indigenous cultures. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 indigenous leaders from within this bioregion to explore their mental models of sustainability. These interviews followed a general structure that covered: (a) the personal background and community affiliation of each interviewee; (b) the meaning of the concept of sustainability from their perspective; (c) visions of a sustainable future for their communities; and, (d) how to achieve such a future.

A content analysis of the interviews was conducted and summarized into a narrative organized to correspond with the general interview structure. A process oftestimonial validity established that most participants found the narrative to be an accurate representation of their perspectives. Participant feedback led to several phrasing changes and other identified issues are discussed, including one participant's critique of the narrative's use of a first-person plural voice. Major themes from the interviews include the role of the human being as caretaker actively participating in the web of life, the importance of simultaneously restoring culture and ecology due to their interdependence, the need to educate and build awareness, and the importance of cooperation. Understanding who we are as a living species, including our profound connection with nature, along with a holistic and intergenerational perspective are suggested as prerequisite for balancing and aligning human modes of being with the larger patterns of life. The closing discussion addresses the importance of social action and going beyond a conceptual understanding to an embodiment of sustainability."

Native American tribes make up one segment of society with a particular interest in and deep ties to land and resources. Vancouver, Washington-based Columbia Land Trust recognizes tribes' special relationships with their ancestral lands and resources thereon, but has struggled to develop policies that involve tribes in conserved areas and conservation plans. The conception among mainstream scientists that western conservation science is better equipped than Indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) to determine best practices is one part of that struggle. Another part, however, is the organization's limited capacity to holistically review and revise its policies and to engage respectfully with multiple sovereign nations in a coordinated and ongoing manner. Using political ecology as a lens for examining the asymmetry of power over land and resources, this research explores the most appropriate path forward in Land Trust-tribe relationship development. I conducted a combination of semi-structured interviews with tribe and Land Trust representatives (N=11), a survey of Land Trust staff, board members, and volunteers (N=47), participant observation among Land Trust staff, board members, and volunteers (N>20), and a review of literature pertaining to relationships between other conservation organizations and tribes. Overarching questions addressed each party's concerns and expectations around Land Trust-tribe relationships, and what cultural differences might challenge these relationships. Additional questions pertaining to tribes' histories, rights, treaties, and the impacts of colonization were directed at Land Trust participants to gauge their preparedness to engage respectfully with tribes/sovereign nations. An analysis of interview transcripts and descriptive statistics from survey data revealed three main themes: 1) Indigenous culture and IEK challenge conventional western conservation science, but in practice there is (or will be) significant overlap in conservation objectives and approaches; 2) Land Trust-tribe partnerships make practical sense and help to advance justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) goals; and 3) while all parties seem prepared to respectfully engage, some apprehension remains on the part of the Land Trust to commit to taking that next step -- an increased and dedicated effort may be necessary to initiate negotiations, draw up agreements, and orchestrate ongoing partnering efforts. These findings, in conjunction with existing literature, substantiate my argument encouraging Columbia Land Trust to institute policies and a strategy for involving tribes in regional conservation planning and in restoration and stewardship projects at select sites. Further, the findings may instill greater confidence for all parties involved to move forward in relationship-building processes. Through such processes, it is feasible that partners will learn to trust that each other's objectives and approaches to conservation (based either in western science or IEK) will overlap and/or are negotiable, and that partnering will improve conservation and social justice outcomes. This study provides a unique example of justice- and inclusivity-based relationship-building between one conservation organization and multiple tribes, each with varying conservation interests and capacities. Further, it contributes to a growing body of literature calling for conservation professionals to honor Indigenous rights and recognize the value of their ecological knowledge.

Their ancestral territory spans parts of Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and California. My research identifies and describes the heterogeneous character of Nuwuvi ecological knowledge (NEK) of piñon-juniper woodland ecosystems within two federal protected areas (PAs) in southeastern Nevada, the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (SMNRA) and the Desert National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR), as remembered and practiced to varying degrees by 22 select Nuwuvi knowledge holders. I focus my investigation on four primary aspects of NEK. First, drawing from data obtained through ethnoecological research, I discuss how Nuwuvi ecological knowledge evolved through protracted observation and learning from past resource depletions, and adapted to various environmental and socio-economic drivers of change induced since Euro-American incursion. Second, I argue that Nuwuvi management practices operate largely within a framework of non-equilibrium ecology, marked by low to intermediate disturbances and guided by Nuwuvi conceptions of environmental health and balance. These practices favor landscape heterogeneity and patchiness, and engender ecosystem renewal, expanded ecotones, and increased biodiversity. I then consider the third and fourth aspects of NEK as two case studies that consider NEK at the individual, species, population, habitat, and landscape scales. These case studies operationalize NEK as a relevant body of knowledge and techniques conducive to collaborative resource stewardship initiatives with federal land management agency partners. In the first case study I suggest that the Great Basin piñon pines are Nuwuvi cultural keystone species (CKS), evaluating their central importance to Nuwuvi according to several criteria including number of uses, role in ritual and story, and uniqueness relative to other species. In the second case study I contend that local social institutions regulated Nuwuvi resource use in the past and in some cases continued to do so at the time of study. These local social institutions included a system of resource extraction and habitat entrance taboos that may have mitigated impacts and supported sustainable resource use and conservation. The implications of this research are that Nuwuvi ecological knowledge, disturbance-based adaptive management practices, and resource and habitat taboos are relevant to contemporary land management concerns in piñon-juniper woodlands, offering complementary approaches to adaptive management as practiced in the SMNRA and the DNWR despite divergent epistemological foundations. My research contributed to the Nuwuvi Knowledge-to-Action Project, an applied government-to-government consultation, collaborative resource stewardship, and cultural revitalization project facilitated by The Mountain Institute among seven Nuwuvi Nations, the U.S. Forest Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

As legal mandates and growing institutional pressures increasingly call for the integration of tribal representatives into the decision-making bodies of museums and authoritative institutions, cross-cultural collaboration and partnerships have increased significantly. With little precedent guiding public historians and museum professionals through this new and complex system of collaboration, the path unfolding in the journey towards the “indigenization”; of museums has been marked with achievements and challenges that have both taught and tested historical professionals. The following is a case study that examines the ways in which this unfolding shift in Native American representation manifested itself in the reconstruction of a Chinookan plankhouse in the early 21st century. With a common objective of educating visitors about the significant cultural and natural history of the former site of the Cathlapotle village, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Chinook Indian Nation teamed up to design, fund, construct and interpret the Cathlapotle Plankhouse in Ridgefield, Washington. Despite sharing a common goal for the reconstruction of a full-scale Chinookan plankhouse, different motivations and agendas guided the decision-making process and required both partners to make compromises that challenged each other’s understanding and expectations of the project. In this work, I analyze how these two organizations navigated the rewarding yet challenging realm of cross-cultural collaboration to create a meaningful and significant heritage site for a wide range of user groups. From this analysis, I hope to provide public historians and museum professionals a detailed example of a cross-cultural partnership that will assist them as they move forward through a continuously unfolding and largely uncharted system of collaboration.

One such strategy is the risk assessment approach. Typically, to guide ongoing and future management of vulnerable cultural resources, risk assessments consider preexisting archaeological data, alongside geomorphological and hydrological landform characteristics, to prioritize sites for preservation. While such assessments have been conducted around the globe, they have not been widely applied on the Lower Columbia of Oregon and Washington (U.S.A.), nor has a localized methodology been developed, particularly one that incorporates the perspectives and values of descendent communities, through a collaborative partnership.

My research took such a collaborative approach to risk assessment, via a case study of the western shoreline of Sauvie Island, located on the Lower Columbia River, in partnership with one of several tribes with strong ties to the river, the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde. My project examined an area of cultural significance to develop a baseline prioritization assessment, using the novel strategy of waterborne survey via kayak to access my study area. I posed two primary research questions: -- 1) What forces negatively impacted cultural heritage resources? 2) How did tribal partners prioritize cultural resources for preservation?

To address these questions, I conducted fieldwork over the course of several months along the ~34 km western shoreline of Sauvie Island, recording 18 archaeological sites, including 8 previously recorded sites and 10 newly identified ones. Using GIS capable devices and geotagged photography, I recorded nearly 2,000 artifacts, as well as in situ cultural deposits, dateable features, and diagnostic artifacts. These elements of the physical archaeological assemblage factored into a series of six variables defining archaeological value. I also recorded factors which put each site at risk, such as erosion and modern cultural impacts. To obtain tribal input about their views of value, I had seven collaborative meetings with staff members of the Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO) from the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde. Through an iterative process of editing and review, we identified six variables that communicated how the Grand Ronde value cultural resources. Together, archaeological and tribal values and risk assessment scores were joined to create prioritization preservation scores for each of the 18 sites recorded during my project.

The application of the prioritization assessment process identified two sites scoring ""Very High"", four sites scoring ""High"", four sites scoring ""Medium"", seven sites scoring ""Low"", and one site placed in the ""Very Low"" group. The assessment process showed where archaeological and tribal values overlapped, largely in areas of proximity to ethnographic locations and rare characteristics of the site. The assessment also showed where sites diverged, where tribal values recognized the potential of a site over the observed physical assemblage, and where, most importantly, sites retained reconnectivity, or an aspect that the tribe could reengage with, be it through land access, the activities that could be conducted at the site, or the context of other sites and ethnographic locations around it. Additionally, the assessment also highlighted ways sites are vulnerable to loss from erosion. Fifteen of the 18 sites have some combination of sheer eroding banks, slumping, undercutting, or sheer beach edge. Sediment starvation due to upstream river dams and boat wake are the main forces of erosion along the shoreline.

My project has several values. First, I have provided an up-to-date overview of cultural resources along the western shoreline of Sauvie Island for the Oregon State Historic Preservation Office and other agencies, such as the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. This alone will be useful for management purposes. Second, I have created a preservation prioritization process which allows for a systematic review of archaeological values, tribal values, and risk factors. This process could be applied both in the Lower Columbia and elsewhere. Third, through a collaborative effort with my Grand Ronde tribal partners, I have identified a number of tribal values that reflect how a descendant community views cultural resources. This case study has produced a risk assessment template based not only on archaeological value, but also value to descendent communities. Future work should expand the assessment to include perspectives from other tribes with ties to Sauvie Island."

Using evidence from archives, newspapers, and historical maps, this study identifies the forces which influenced the development and use of cemeteries in Portland and Salem, Oregon during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In Salem, the reinterpretation of the story of Methodist Mission leader Jason Lee culminated in an elaborate reinterment ceremony nearly sixty years after his death at the cemetery he had helped found. By contrast, the remains of Indigenous children who died while attending Lee's mission school and those who died while patients at the Oregon Insane Asylum are now lost, though they were buried only a few hundred feet from Lee's eventual resting place. In Portland, the city government left behind a wake of tangled paperwork and actual bodies in its failed attempts to provide early Portlanders with a space for the dead. Finally, a private group founded a large, modern cemetery akin to the world-famous Green-wood or Mount Auburn Cemeteries on the East Coast. Portlanders had finally addressed the ""last great necessity"" of the city, and were ready for more residents and more investors. Studying the development and history of cemeteries in Oregon is a unique and underutilized way to understand how the forces of colonization, urbanization, and memory manifest in both the shared memories and physical landscapes of our communities.

From these partnerships, the Future Generations Collaborative was formed representing a significant shift toward community-led maternal child health research and planning. Additionally, the Future Generations Collaborative adopted a historical trauma-informed community based participatory research and planning process. This is particularly significant considering government agencies' role in colonization within Native communities. The purpose of this case study is to explore partnerships between government agencies and the Portland Native community within the Future Generations Collaborative. Given the profound influence of historical trauma in Native communities, this paper addresses how the partnerships between government agencies and the Portland Native community pose distinct opportunities, challenges, and implications.

Drawing from FGC members' lived experiences and an interdisciplinary body of research, I develop a theoretical model for explaining the government's role in creating and sustaining historical trauma within Native communities. This analysis provides critical context for examining the impact of historical trauma on the relationships between government agencies and the Portland Native community within the FGC. By entering methodological discussions of Native-specific community-based participatory research, this study also addresses how the use of a trauma-informed research and planning model affects the relationships between government agencies and the Portland Native community within the FGC."

Past research has implicated `attitudes toward science' as an important factor in the public's participation in science. I applied Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior to attitudes toward science to predict science-related sustainability-action intentions and evaluated whether scientists and Native Americans differed in their general attitudes toward science, cultural values, and specific beliefs about science. Analyses revealed that positive attitude toward science and the cultural value of individualism predicted intentions to engage with science-related sustainability actions. Unexpectedly, scientists and Native Americans did not differ in their cultural values or positive attitude toward science. However, Natives Americans held significantly more negative attitude toward science than scientists. Implications for science education and attitudes towards science theory and application are discussed.

Kirkpatrick (1825-1910); Indians of North America -- Oregon -- Port Orford,Portland State University,1345486010,https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/5771/,record,45.51112737,-122.6833014,Text,"On June 9, 1851, nine men under the direction of a steamboat captain and land speculator named William Tichenor landed on the southern coast of the Oregon Territory at present-day Port Orford with the intention of establishing a permanent settlement. Tichenor's plan was to establish a commercial port that would supply gold mining endeavors in the interior. The landing party's instructions were to survey the townsite while Tichenor traveled to San Francisco to gather more men and supplies. Before departing, he promised the group he would return in exactly two weeks. He also assured them that the local Quatomah Indians, who had lived in the area for generations, were friendly and peaceful.

When Tichenor returned to the site, two days later than he had promised, he discovered that a violent confrontation had taken place atop a large, rocky promontory on the beach. The landing party was nowhere to be found and a subsequent investigation led to the discovery of two discarded journals which provided insight into what had transpired. As a result, it was assumed that all the men in the landing party had either been killed or taken captive by the Quatomah, and a letter was quickly sent to the editor of a Portland newspaper giving a suspiciously contrived account of the grim discovery. It had been written by a San Francisco attorney named D.S. Roberts, who not only claimed that Tichenor had arrived back at Port Orford on time, but that the landing party had recklessly fled their fortified camp and were therefore ultimately at fault for whatever had befallen them.

One week after Tichenor had returned to the site, the missing landing party turned up alive and well at a settlement approximately 65 miles to the north. After reading Roberts' account of their supposed demise in the newspaper, the appointed leader of the group, J.M. Kirkpatrick, became upset by the claim that he and the others may have acted foolishly by abandoning their camp prior to Tichenor's return. Leaving the rest of the group behind, Kirkpatrick quickly traveled to Portland where he presented a letter to the editor of a local newspaper refuting Tichenor's supposed punctuality and defending the actions of him and his men.

This thesis attempts to explain what really happened at ""Battle Rock,"" and why. Through an examination of these two letters, a picture emerges of a public relations struggle that ultimately obscured what really happened between the landing party and the Quatomah. As head of the enterprise, Tichenor attempted to get in front of the blowback that a massacre of white men in his employ might generate by utilizing Roberts as an ""impartial"" witness whose testimony, via the letter, exculpated him of any wrongdoing. This inadvertently placed Kirkpatrick--who was assumed dead--on the defensive, compelling him to respond with a courageous narrative justifying the actions of him and his men. Although not wanting to be alienated from the potential financial rewards of the Port Orford enterprise, Kirkpatrick fit his account within the parameters established by Roberts' letter. In this way, the aftermath helped create the event. The price for this was historical truth, particularly as it related to the Quatomah. They were not only the victims of a massacre, but were then cast as villains in a highly-consequential story outside of their control."

Contribution to this lack of attention may be due to little being known about American Indian youth victimization. Even less is known about its association with alcohol and marijuana use in general and for those youth living on or near reservations in particular.

This study utilizes mixed methods with a nationally representative sample of American Indian youth living on or near reservations in the first phase. A qualitative study in the second phase followed up with a group of practitioners serving American Indian youth living on or near a reservation to explore the association between victimization and alcohol and marijuana use. Understanding the perceptions of practitioners presents an opportunity for collaborative knowledge creation on the conceptualization of victimization and its relationship to alcohol and marijuana use.

A secondary data analysis utilizing ordinary least squares regression yielded several significant contributions to alcohol and marijuana user levels when the models were run with the sample intact and when run by gender and compared side-by-side. Extending these findings to a qualitative follow-up produced themes that illustrated practitioner conceptualizations of victimization and perceptions about the influence of these experiences on alcohol and marijuana use among the American Indian youth they serve. Study findings inform or enhance substance use treatment design, delivery, and policy, and to advocate for tribal sovereignty and self-determination.

In this thesis, selected works by two Wayuu writers, Estercilia Simanca Pushaina and Vicenta Maria Siosi Pino, are analyzed and interpreted in an attempt to unveil some of these behind-the-scenes agents and issues, as well as explore how the stories' classification in the children's literature genre reveals a deep-rooted colonial tendency to infantilize indigenous individuals in contemporary Colombia.

Despite the fact that the two authors, both mestizo women who self-identify with the Wayuu indigenous group of northern Colombia, prefer to write short stories that highlight the child and adolescent experience, the implicit themes and the complexity of their texts reject the ""children's story"" label that has been imposed on their literature. Furthermore, this thesis discusses how the two authors utilize the colonial trope of the Indian-as-child to their advantage by capsizing the imagery, thus rejecting the original power of the symbol and claiming it as their own.

The first section of this investigation provides certain contextual specifics related to the cultural and social environment of the Wayuu indigenous group, particularly regarding that experienced by women. The second chapter includes an explanation of the impact a book's genre and its ""paratext"" may have on the reception and interpretation of these texts, and additionally proposes that the colonial practice of infantilizing indigenous people appears in both the assignment of genre as well as in several extratextual elements surrounding the stories. Chapter three offers an in-depth analysis of five selected pieces of the Wayuu authors' writing and explores how the texts may be read on multiple levels. This close reading reveals several examples of overt criticism towards the hegemonic society as well as displays instances of a more subtle rebellion; both explicit and implicit messages effectively expose and protest the current conditions of abuse, oppression and injustice that continue to anguish the Wayuu people.

It argues that the experience of the agricultural working class is central not just to a physical movement towards tangible agricultural change but to a society's ability to understand its socio-cultural and natural environment. The thesis first explores indigenous literature, then agricultural practices and finally educational movements which seek to express pluriversal understandings and ways of interacting with the planet. It argues that these understandings apply not only in contexts from which they emerge such as Chiapas but here in Oregon and internationally as we find our species in an era of global environmental, social and spiritual crisis. This cross disciplinary approach intentionally breaks rules of both ecological and agricultural study and literary analysis to show how ways of knowing do not follow the rules of genre. Though it evades a simple definition, living literature is the stories that grow like seeds, passed down through generations and expressed not just verbally or in written form, but through agricultural and social actions. Literatura Viva argues that this inclusive and explicitly morally charged form of interdisciplinary study is crucial for future educational agricultural and literary paradigms.

Perhaps half of the 6,000-7,000 languages worldwide will go extinct in the next 50-100 years. One of these dying languages, Chinook Jargon or Chinuk Wawa, a language found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, is in the process of being revitalized through the concerted efforts of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde (CTGR). Reasons to revitalize endangered languages often seem irrelevant to our modern daily lives, and revitalizing these languages is a difficult process requiring much dedication, commitment, and persistence. In light of this significant struggle, understanding people's motivations could contribute to a better understanding of how to involve more people in language revitalization. Ideally, such an understanding would contribute to strengthening a community's efforts to revitalize their language. This exploratory, ethnographic case study explores the motivations of eight participants in the Portland Chinuk Wawa language community involved in revitalizing Chinuk Wawa over a nine-month period in 2011. The results of the study showed that seven major themes of motivation were prevalent for the participants: connections made through Chinuk Wawa, preservation of Chinuk Wawa, relationships, instrumental motivation, affective motivation, identity motivation, and demotivation.

Through this analysis, I challenge commonly held stereotypes that the indigenous people of the Willamette Valley were strictly root eaters, and the basis for this claim, that salmon were not part of Native subsistence. The results of my research indicate that given the incomplete nature of the ethnohistoric record, very little can be said about expected cultural behaviors, such as salmon consumption, that appear to be absent in the Willamette Valley. In addition, since the faunal assemblage is so small in the Willamette Valley, zooarchaeological data are simply inadequate for studying the relationship between prehistoric peoples and their animal resources. Finally, optimal foraging modeling suggests that salmon is one of the higher ranked resources available to the Native People of the Willamette Valley.

The texts were developed as part of the language and culture program of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon for use in university-sponsored language classes. The collaborative process of developing 12 texts was explored through detailed revision analysis and interviews with the materials developers and other stakeholders.

Fluent non-native speakers relied on collaboration, historical documentation, reference materials, grammatical models, and their own intuitions and cultural sensibilities to develop texts that would be both faithful to the speech of previous generations and effective for instruction. The texts studied were stories and cultural information developed through research-based composition, translation from interlinear and narrative English in ethnographic sources, and editing of transcribed oral narrative.

The revision analysis identified points of discussion in the lexical development and grammatical standardization of the language. The preferred strategy for developing new vocabulary was use of language-internal resources such as compounding although borrowing and loan translation from other local Native languages were also sometimes considered appropriate. The multifunctionality of the lexicon and evidence of dialectal and idiolectal usage problematicized the description of an “ideal” language for pedagogical purposes. Concerns were also expressed about detailed grammatical modeling due to potential influence on non-native speaker intuitions and the non-utility of such models for revitalization goals.

Decisions made in the process of developing texts contributed to the development of a written form of Chinuk Wawa that would honor and perpetuate the oral language while adapting it for the requirements of inscription. The repeated inclusion of discourse markers and the frequent removal of nominal reference brought final versions of texts closer to oral style, while inclusion of background information and the avoidance of shortened pronouns and auxiliaries customized the presentation for a reading audience.

The results of this study comprise a sketch of one aspect of the daily work of language revitalization, in which non-native speakers shoulder responsibility for the growth of a language and its transfer to new generations of speakers."
ps25,A Spatial Analysis of Ceramics in Northwestern Alaska: Studying Pre-Contact Gendered Use of Space,Katelyn Elizabeth Braymer-Hayes,2018,Thesis,Anthropology,Indians of North America -- Alaska; Northwest -- Antiquities; Sexual division of labor; Spatial analysis (Statistics) in archaeology,Portland State University,1078898322,https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/4357/,record,45.51112737,-122.6833014,Text,"Activities and production among ethnographic Arctic peoples were primarily divided by gender. This gendered division of labor also extended to a spatial segregated pattern of the household in some Arctic cultures. Other cultures had a more gender-integrated spatial pattern of the household. There have been very few archaeological studies of gender in the Arctic, and even fewer studies of gendered use of space.

In this thesis, I evaluated the existence of this gendered use of space in pre-contact Northwest Alaska. I also evaluated the existence of discrete activity spaces. I drew from both ethnoarchaeology and gender/feminist archaeology to both construct my hypotheses and interpret my results. I used ceramics, which were likely primarily made by and used by women, as a proxy for women's movement within the house. Ceramics are abundant and well-preserved in many Northwestern Alaskan sites, and are well suited for a robust spatial analysis. In addition to ceramics, I also evaluated the spatial density of other female artifacts, like ulus or scrapers, and male artifacts, like harpoon points or adzes, in order to further test the existence of gender specific use of space.

I tested this using the HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm in Python, a programming language. HDBSCAN identifies discrete clusters of artifacts, as well as the persistence, or stability, of the cluster. Birnirk and Thule era (1300-150 BP) house features from Cape Espenberg, Alaska, were used to test these expectations.

Based on the results of my spatial analysis, I did not find any evidence of gender specific use of space, nor did I find specific activity areas within the house. My findings are not necessarily an indication that gender-segregated use of space does not exist among pre-contact Northwest Alaskan people: I just did not find evidence supporting it. This could be, in part, due to issues of sample size, house size, and the role of secondary and post deposition processes in shaping the ceramic assemblage and distribution. While ceramics did cluster, they mostly clustered in the entrance tunnel of the house. This is likely the result of cleaning, storage, or other depositional processes. When ceramics did cluster in the main rooms, clustering was idiosyncratic. Male and female artifacts were not spatially segregated. Female artifacts were slightly more likely to cluster than male artifacts. Both sets of artifacts were generally in the same area as the ceramic clusters. While this study did not find evidence of gendered use of space, it still is an important contribution of addressing questions of gender in the Arctic. In addition, it is a valuable methodological contribution, using a clustering algorithm that previously has not been frequently used by archaeologists."

Although researchers in the field have discovered ways to enhance the effectiveness of training programs through the design, delivery, and evaluation process, research has not provided empirically-based recommendations for how to best train individuals whose cultural backgrounds may influence receptiveness of training curriculum. This is particularly relevant for employees whose cultural groups have been historically discriminated against, where cultural norms implicit in the training design may be met with resistance on behalf of the trainees. In the field of multicultural education, an instructional approach has been suggested to overcome cultural differences between instructor, curriculum writers, and students known as culturally responsive education. I evaluated a pre-training video prime based on this approach in the context of multi-site data-use training program for Native American educational professionals. Data-use training was delivered after exposure to one of two videos that framed the objectives of data use either in a culturally responsive way or in a generic mainstream fashion. Participants filled out surveys after the video but before the training, and then again after the training. Prime type was randomly assigned by training location. I hypothesized that participants who received a culturally responsive training prime would learn more during the data-usage training than participants who did not, and that this effect would be mediated by heightened affective motivators immediately following the culturally responsive prime. None of the hypothesized pathways were supported. There was no direct effect of my prime manipulation on knowledge (Hypothesis 1) or skill acquisition (H2), or on pre-training motivation to learn (H3), research-related self-efficacy (H4), goal-commitment (H5), or identification with research (H6). Furthermore, there were no indirect effects of my manipulation on knowledge (H7) or skill (H8) acquisition through pre-training motivation to learn, self-efficacy, goal-commitment, or identification with research. The motivation to learn subscale for valence had a significant positive direct effect on knowledge and skill acquisition and self-efficacy significantly positively predicted skill acquisition. Goal-commitment and motivation to learn subscales for instrumentality and expectancy had a significant negative relationship with skill acquisition. Lack of support for my hypothesized pathways is explained partially by the failure of my independent variable to influence perceptions of cultural responsiveness. A manipulation check revealed that participants did not appraise my culturally responsive priming video as significantly more relevant or culturally appropriate compared to the alternative mainstream video. Findings on the positive effects of valence and self-efficacy are discussed in support of current literature. Negative effects of expectancy are discussed in terms of stereotype threat. The implications and applications for trainers and researchers in training and minority education are followed by a consideration of this study’s limitations and suggestions for future research.

There they encountered large villages of Chinookan and other Native Americans. Soon afterwards, the Chinookan People became involved in the global fur trade. Pelts, supplies, and native made goods were exchanged with fur traders, who in return provided Chinookans with a number of trade goods. Over the next 40 years, life changed greatly for the Chinookans; new trade and political alliances were created, foreign goods were introduced, and diseases killed large portions of the population (Hajda 1984; Gibson 1992; Schwantes 1996; Boyd 2011; Boyd et al. 2013). Additionally, fur trade forts, like the Hudson's Bay Company's (HBC) Fort Vancouver, were established. At these forts, new multiethnic communities were created to support the fur trade economy (Hussey 1957; Kardas 1971; Warner and Munnik 1972; Erigero 1992; Burley 1997; Mackie 1997; Wilson 2010).

This thesis is an historical archaeological study of how Chinookan peoples at three villages and employees of the later multicultural Village at Fort Vancouver negotiated the processes of contact and colonization. Placed in the theoretical framework of practice theory, everyday ordinary activities are studied to understand how cultural identities are created, reinforced, and changed (Lightfoot et al. 1998; Martindale 2009; Voss 2008). Additionally uneven power relationships are examined, in this case between the colonizer and the colonized, which could lead to subjugation but also resistance (Silliman 2001). In order to investigate these issues, this thesis studies how the new foreign material of vessel glass was and was not used during the everyday practice of tool production.

Archaeological studies have found that vessel glass, which has physical properties similar to obsidian, was used to create a variety of tool forms by cultures worldwide (Conte and Romero 2008). Modified glass studies (Harrison 2003; Martindale and Jurakic 2006) have demonstrated that they can contribute important new insights into how cultures negotiated colonization. In this study, modified glass tools from three contact period Chinookan sites: Cathlapotle, Meier, and Middle Village, and the later multiethnic Employee Village of Fort Vancouver were examined. Glass tool and debitage analysis based on lithic macroscopic analytical techniques was used to determine manufacturing techniques, tool types, and functions. Additionally, these data were compared to previous analyses of lithics and trade goods at the study sites.

This thesis demonstrates that Chinookans modified glass into tools, though there was variation in the degree to which glass was modified and the types of tools that were produced between sites. Some of these differences are probably related to availability, how glass was conceptualized by Native Peoples, or other unidentified causes. This study suggests that in some ways glass was just another raw material, similar to stone, that was used to create tools that mirrored the existing lithic technology. However at Cathlapotle at least, glass appears to have been relatively scarce and perhaps valued even as a status item. While at Middle Village, glass (as opposed to stone) was being used about a third of the time to produce tools.

Glass tool technology at Cathlapotle, Meier, and Middle Village was very similar to the existing stone tool technology dominated by expedient/low energy tools; however, novel new bottle abraders do appear at Middle Village. This multifaceted response reflects how some traditional lifeways continued, while at the same time new materials and technology was recontextualized in ways that made sense to Chinookan peoples.

Glass tools increase at the Fort Vancouver Employee Village rather than decrease through time. This response appears to be a type of resistance to the HBC's economic hegemony and rigid social structure. Though it is impossible to know if such resistance was consciously acted on or was just part of everyday activities that made sense in the economic climate of the time.

Overall, this thesis demonstrates how a mundane object such as vessel glass, can provide a wealth of information about how groups like the Chinookans dealt with a changing world, and how the multiethnic community at Fort Vancouver dealt with the hegemony of the HBC. Chinookan peoples and the later inhabitants of the Fort Vancouver Employee Village responded to colonization in ways that made sense to their larger cultural system. These responses led to both continuity and change across time."

NAFB manages the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), land and air space in southern Nevada, which includes Native American ancestral lands. During a research period of 3 months in the spring/summer of 2012, I interviewed members of Native American nations culturally affiliated with ancestral lands on the NTTR, the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah (PITU) and the Bishop Paiute Tribe. My research included participant observation and 31 interviews with tribal members considered knowledge holders by tribal leaders. In dialogue with the literature of the anthropology of food, political economy, and Critical Medical Anthropology, my analysis focused on the role of heritage foods in everyday consumption, taking into account the economic, social, environmental, and political factors influencing heritage foods access and diet. My work explored the effects of structural forces and rapid changes in diet and social conditions on Native American health. I found shifts in concepts of food-related identity across ethnic groups, tribes, ages, and genders. I also found evidence of collective efforts to improve diet-related health at tribal and community levels. Through the applied aspects of my research, participants and their families had the opportunity to share recipes and food dishes containing heritage foods as a way to promote human health and knowledge transmission.

Proposed is a theory of intergenerational transmission that explains four pathways used by Indian women to gain information about pregnancy and childbirth. Antecedent, consequent, and core elements are associated with the transmission process.

Discriminant sampling was used to identify the middle generation of Indian mothers and grandmothers, between 36 and 65 years of age, residing on or near the reservation, with experience of assimilation policies that had moved off-reservation temporarily. The researcher used the grounded theory method to analyze responses to the profile instrument, the Ethnic, Culture, Religion/Spirituality (ECR) instrument (Cross, 1995), May's (1982) social integration schema, and open-ended focus group interviews. Two focus groups were conducted, Group I with 4 women, and Group II with 3 women.

The ECR questionnaire was used to describe aspects of cultural strengths believed to be associated with the presence of resiliency. May's (1982) social integration schema was used to describe attributes of social adaptation/integration to culture and as a way to predict susceptibility to problem behavior, such as alcohol use.

Interview data were analyzed using the method of constant comparative analysis. The resulting model of intergenerational pathways among Native American women described antecedent, consequent, and core elements of the transmission of culture.

In the process of cultural transmission, the middle generation of women identified with balancing both world views. Yet, in comparison with the Rural Oregon Minority Prenatal Project study (1995a), elders identified more with the traditional world, and the young Indian women did not identify with either world and were described as caught between two worlds. It is hypothesized then that urban Indian women, living off-reservation or with limited access to Indian culture, would identify more with the modern contemporary world rather than with the traditional Indian world."

The method involved coding character traits according to type with regard to representation, ability, or attribute to ascertain patterns among the codes and elucidate character roles and relationships, reorganizing the coded traits into paired polarized correspondences to clarify relationships among traits, and assessing pronoun use and documenter effect pointing to gender-specific character activity. Findings revealed an encoded framework illuminating how the tale is used to represent progressive stages in the Dakota vision quest. Analysis using simple word counts of character traits produced emergent patterns disclosing a male-specific focus on character activities with additional evidence delineating a framework for the vision quest traditionally regarded tribally as a male rite of passage.

However, little is known about the associations between racial and heterosexist discrimination and HIV risk behavior. Further, little is known about the mechanisms of the association between racial and heterosexist discrimination and HIV risk behavior. There is some evidence to suggest that depression may be a mechanism that mediates the relationship between racial and heterosexist discrimination and HIV risk behavior. Thus, one purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which discrimination based on both race and sexual orientation, alone and in combination, are associated with HIV risk behavior. A secondary purpose of this study was to examine whether the relationship between discrimination and HIV risk behavior is mediated by depressive symptoms. Lastly this study sought to examine whether the relationships between discrimination, depressive symptoms, and HIV risk behavior were mediated by social support, LGBT and Native identity, and LGBT and Native community participation.

This study analyzed data from the HONOR project, the first national study of two-spirit individuals, which included 221 American Indian and Alaska Native MSM. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which experiences of racial and heterosexist discrimination were associated with HIV risk behavior. Results indicate that heterosexist discrimination was associated with HIV risk behaviors, whereas racial discrimination was not. Conversely, results indicate that racial discrimination was associated with depressive symptoms, whereas heterosexist discrimination was not. This study found no association between depressive symptoms and HIV risk behavior, even when accounting for alcohol and substance use. Results indicate that depressive symptoms are not a mechanism that explains the association between discrimination and HIV risk and perhaps the better mechanism to examine in future studies is substance use. Finally, LGBT community participation was shown to have protective effects against HIV risk behaviors.

These findings have the potential to guide development of mental health and HIV prevention interventions for Native MSM, with special attention to LGBT community participation and social support. Future research should examine attributes such as types, sources, and frequency of heterosexist discrimination and LGBT community participation."

During his years of leadership, 1876-1911 he managed an uneven stability. One method he used to promote nationalism was the use of symbols. This thesis derives from the theory introduced by the historian of Mexican economy, Barbara Tenenbaum, that the Porfirian administrators attempted to establish themselves as the legitimate rulers of the Mexican nation by forging a line of succession from the ancient Aztecs to themselves through association with indigenous symbols and territory. The intention of this thesis is to demonstrate that the Mexican government manipulated images of indigenous peoples to inspire nationalism aimed at legitimizing Porfirio Diaz's administration.

Chapter one discusses the domestic backdrop against which the alteration of the Aztec image took place. Chapter two discusses the international opinion regarding the Aztecs. Chapter three describes the appropriation process by which the images were manipulated through the creation of the position of the national archaeologist. Archaeological symbols leaked into federalized public art. Chapter four examines the public monuments erected bearing European and Aztec symbolism. Chapter five looks at Diaz's involvement in the appropriation of symbols and the public's critical attitude of the process.

An important aspect of this thesis is the evidence on which I based my ideas. The evidence is a mixture of political and archaeological writings, government reports, travel and newspaper accounts, brochures, advertisements, monuments, art works, artifacts, codices, photographs, speeches and fiestas. These various sources come from the layers of international and Porfirian society. They explain the persuasiveness of the ""noble savage"" image of Aztecs throughout these levels of Mexico. Through the attitudes of the upper classes these sources reveal the way in which domestically and internationally the Aztec image was sometimes embraced and sometimes rejected as a national emblem for Mexico. Ultimately, the evidence explains the failure of indigenous images as an positive international symbol for Mexico."

Media technologies, including the Internet, cell phones, and video games, offer new avenues for reaching adolescents on a wide range of sensitive health topics. While several studies have informed the development of technology-based interventions targeting mainstream youth, no such data have been reported for AI/AN youth. To fill this gap, I: a) quantified media technology use in a select group of AI/AN teens and young adults living in Pacific Northwest tribes and urban communities; b) identified patterns in their health information-seeking and media preferences; and c) worked with local tribes and partners to develop recommendations for designing culturally-appropriate technology-based interventions targeting Native adolescents. This research included: a) an anonymous, paper-based survey of over 400 AI/AN youths age 13-21 years; b) a systematic review of technology-based sexual health interventions; and c) a variety of community-based participatory research strategies to analyze findings, prioritize options, and generate recommendations for designing interventions that align with the culture, needs, and organizational capacities of the tribes in the Pacific Northwest. Technology use was exceptionally common and diverse among survey respondents, mirroring patterns reported by teens in the general population. Seventy-five percent of AI/AN youth reported using the Internet, 78% reported using cell phones, and 36% reported playing video games on a daily or weekly basis. Thirty-five percent reported that they would feel most comfortable getting sexual health information from the Internet, and 44% reported having done so in the past. Youth expressed interest in a wide array of interactive media features, and culturally-specific content that holistically encompassed their wide-ranging health interests and concerns. Tribal health educators expressed particular interest in adapting Internet-based skill-building modules and informational websites, and teens expressed interest in websites and videos. These findings are now being used by the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board to inform the development and adaptation of culturally-appropriate interventions targeting AI/AN youth in the Pacific Northwest."

Nuwuvi (Southern Paiute) have known and managed these resources for thousands of years prior to Euro-American arrival in the region. A variety of factors, including federal policies that resulted in the creation of reservations and forced placement in boarding schools, as well as contemporary resource commodification, have influenced Nuwuvi knowledge and practice.

In this thesis, I examined the character of Nuwuvi ethnohydrological knowledge, including management knowledge, of two protected areas: Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (SMNRA), managed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and Desert National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR), managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). In addition, I investigated perceptions of water health and restoration among participants from the two managing agencies and six Nuwuvi Nations. I addressed these topics using the theoretical framework of political ecology and a methodology that included semi-structured interviews and demographic questionnaires with 16 Nuwuvi knowledge holders and four federal agency participants. I conducted text analysis of partial interview transcripts using the inductive coding method in order to identify recurring themes and concepts related to hydrology, management, and restoration.

My results illustrated that Nuwuvi ethnohydrological knowledge, which developed incrementally over time, conceptualized water as a sentient being that required human interaction to remain healthy. There was also evidence that Nuwuvi knowledge of water was changing as a result of political, economic, and social forces. Furthermore, these findings suggest that Nuwuvi and agency approaches to hydrological management and restoration were built upon differing epistemologies, though there was convergence among specific management and restoration techniques. Based on these results, a report of findings from the Nuwuvi Knowledge-to-Action project, including recommendations for collaborative stewardship approaches, was delivered to participants in August 2013."

Historians have framed world's fairs and international expositions as sites of legitimating narratives and restagings of empire and nationhood. This thesis focuses on women, Asian Americans, and Native Americans who interrupted and disrupted the performance and exhibition of U.S. imperialism in the specific case of Portland, Oregon. It considers who benefitted from or endured loss in the demonstrations of imperial culture at the Fair. Following the premises that metropolitan and colonial histories should be considered in the same analytical field and that the systemic power of domestic imperialism in the United States extended beyond Native Americans into the experiences of most nonwhite American communities, this thesis adds a metropolitan approach to Native-American history and, in turn, applies a more colonial approach to the study of African-American, Asian-American, and working-class women's histories. In three chapters, this study explores a range of disruptions at the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial - patched over by the Exposition's civic elites and overlooked by previous historians of the Fair - that shed light on the politics of race, class, and gender within the processes of empire and nation building in the turn-of-the-century West.

Although Sacagawea received little attention following the Corps of Discovery's return to the United States, she was rediscovered by writers associated with the women's suffrage movement at the end of the nineteenth century. The development of the enduring American legend that formed around Sacagawea was an Anglo-American and twentieth century phenomenon. In myth, she was given credit for the success of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and over time she became its savior and leader.

It is the purpose of this study to review written records of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and works on the Indian woman to trace the evolution of Sacagawea' s myth in the twentieth century. As important as the myth's relationship with the suffrage movement was, it is also important to investigate the role that professional historians, popular writers, and others played in the expansion of the legend. Did historians agree with popular writers' judgement of Sacagawea' s attributes and her contributions to the expedition? What role, if any, did Native American writers play in the formation and spread of the legends? Did governmental agencies participate in the myth's formation or dissemination? How was Sacagawea's myth altered during the latter part of the century after WWII? And most importantly, how did the Sacagawea myth support or :frame the nation's discussion of the conquest of the continent? In examining these questions, one may form a more complete opinion on the role Sacagawea played in America's Western culture."

This thesis employs a settler colonial framework that places the sexuality and rape of native women at the center of colonial relations in the settlement of the Americas. Viewed through this lens I perform an in-depth analysis of Winnemucca's gendered critique of colonialism that focused on sexual violence. Rather than the unstable, mixed messages of native resistance and assimilation emphasized by earlier scholars, I argue that Winnemucca purposefully employed a strategy of oppositional conformity to publicize an unwavering political message that championed Paiute sovereignty, exposed white cruelty, and re-wrote the dominant gendered, racial, political and cultural constructs that bound Native American women's identity. The introduction begins with a brief history of Winnemucca's life and accomplishments. In the introduction I also address the authenticity of Winnemucca's published narrative, Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims (1883) and identify the constraints of the settler colonial lens through which I view Winnemucca's public voice. In chapter one I argue that Winnemucca's narrative employs the gendered moral rhetoric of the colonizer to cultivate white audience receptiveness, while simultaneously criticizing whites for their brutality against Indians. In chapter two I assert that Winnemucca employed multiple political strategies to cut away at Euro-American settlers' moral justifications for colonialism, and that she articulated a unique vision of Paiute citizenship that rejected complete Indian assimilation. In chapter three I highlight the ways in which Winnemucca used her public voice to articulate rape and the sexuality of Indian women as a foundational part of colonialism hidden from view in the media coverage of the Indian wars of the late nineteenth century. Unlike her biographers, who mostly overlook Winnemucca's public challenge to the negative sexual stereotypes that plagued Indian women during Winnemucca's lifetime, I argue that Indian women's sexuality was a foundational theme in Winnemucca's public discourse. Winnemucca grasped and resisted the gendered dimensions of colonialism and her consistent focus on this theme echoed in her lived reality. Finally, I conclude that ultimately personal accusations as well as her inability to escape the heathen identity forced on Indians by Christian reformers thwarted the success of Winnemucca's political message.

These unions sustained economic alliances and nurtured cultural links.

But the opening of the Oregon Trail brought an influx of white men and women from America's Middle West who stored more than supplies in their wagons. They transported racial beliefs which subjugated all non-whites to an inferior status. Laws were passed by this generation of pioneers in each governmental period -- provisional, territorial and statehood -- which codified a wide spectrum of prejudicial thoughts. This thesis focuses on the interracial marriage bans which were passed in the 1860s, with special consideration given to the 1866 law which stated that it was a criminal offense for a white person to marry a black, Chinese or Hawaiian person of one-fourth or more blood, or an Indian of more than one-half blood. 2 This sweeping marriage ban was not repealed until 1951.

The purpose of this study is to examine white-Indian marriage in the context of this law which existed for eighty-five years. Primary sources are utilized extensively for each of the chapters. Catholic church records underscore the prevalence of white-Indian marriages which existed throughout the region in the years leading up to the 1860s.

The legislative tussle waged over the bill in the 1866 session is complimented by newspaper accounts and Oregon census materials. These documents show clearly how the creation of the comprehensive intermarriage law was steeped in a mixture of national issues and local motivations. This combination of national and local impulses was repeated during the repeal process in 1951.

Valuable Office of Indian Affairs documents from the mid-1880s to the mid-1930s unearth plentiful evidence of interracial marriage during these years. Indian censuses carried out on Oregon's four major reservations preserve a fifty-year legacy of marriages which flouted the law.

In conclusion, this study finds that despite the presence of an Oregon law which levied criminal sanctions against people who even attempted a banned marriage, whites and Indians continued to solemnize their relationships.

Prior investigations have sought to uncover if racial disparities exist within certain aspects of the criminal justice system, such as arrests, trials, and sentencing. The existing scholarship, however, has largely focused on assessing differences between Black and Hispanic offenders in relation to White offenders. There has been little academic exploration to examine if racial disparities exist among American Indian offenders during criminal justice processing. To address this gap in knowledge, this study analyzes data collected from the United States Sentencing Commission to assess if American Indians receive different sentencing outcomes, when compared to other racial groups. The findings from a series of binary logistic and ordinary least square regression analyses suggest that American Indians are sentenced to prison more often than White, Black, and Hispanic offenders, but receive similar sentence lengths compared to Whites and shorter sentence lengths compared to Blacks and Hispanics. The implications of these results are discussed.

Furthermore, only about a third of those entering school actually graduate. A study of Pima and Papago schools revealed much the same trends. Seven percent of the children ages six to eighteen are not enrolled in any school. The researchers estimated a drop-out rate of twenty percent for the teenage group. This was compared to a three and one-half percent drop-out rate for high schools in the surrounding areas. It was also noted that those Indian children who were in school were very likely to be behind their grade placement.

This thesis investigates both plankhouse architecture and the production of these dwellings. Studying plankhouse construction and maintenance provides information regarding everyday labor, landscape use outside of villages, organization of complex tasks, and resource management.

This thesis investigates three plankhouse structures at two sites, Meier and Cathlapotle, in the Lower Columbia River Region of the southern Northwest Coast of North America. Methods consisted of digitizing over 1,100 architectural features, creating detailed maps of architectural features, and conducting statistical and spatial analysis of these features. I use ethnographies, historical documents, experimental archaeology, and ecological studies to characterize the processes of plankhouse production. This information is combined with excavation data from Cathlapotle and Meier to calculate estimates of material and labor required for plankhouse-related activities.

Results of this study support previous inferences regarding house architecture, construction and maintenance at the two sites. Structural elements were frequently replaced, yet overall house appearance changed little over time. Some differences in structural element use and size are noted between the two sites, suggesting that slightly different building techniques may have been employed at the two villages.

Although approximate, calculations of raw materials and person days required for various building tasks provide a glimpse of the massive undertaking entailed in constructing and maintaining plankhouses. These data suggest that an enormous amount of trees were required for construction and maintenance over house occupation, approximately 700-1,200 trees at Meier, 900-2,000 trees at Cathlapotle House 1, and 150-400 trees at Cathlapotle House 4. Estimates of minimum person days entailed for tasks related to initial construction range from 1,400-2,800 at Meier, to 2,100-4,500 at Cathlapotle House 1, to 350-700 at Cathlapotle House 4. In highlighting the articulation of plankhouse labor with household reproduction, this thesis demonstrates the important interplay between material outputs, everyday action, and sociopolitical aspects of Northwest Coast society."

Faunal remains are one potential but as yet underutilized path for examining this relationship. My thesis work takes on this approach through the analysis of fish remains from the Cathlapotle archaeological site (45CL1). Cathlapotle is a large Chinookan village site located on the Lower Columbia River that was extensively excavated in the 1990s. Previous work has established prestige distinctions between houses and house compartments, making it possible to examine the relationship between prestige and the spatial distribution of fish remains. In this study, I examine whether having high prestige afforded its bearers greater access to preferred fish, utilizing comparisons of fish remains at two different levels of social organization, between and within households, to determine which social mechanisms could account for potential differences in access to fish resources. Differential access to these resources within the village could have occurred through household-level ownership of harvesting sites or control over the post-harvesting distribution of food by certain individuals.

Previous work in this region on the relationship between faunal remains and prestige has relied heavily on ethnohistoric sources to determine the relative value of taxa. These sources do not provide adequate data to make detailed comparisons between all of the taxa encountered at archaeological sites, so in this study I utilize optimal foraging theory as an alternative means of determining which fish taxa were preferred. Optimal foraging theory provides a universal, quantitative analytical rule for ranking fish that I was able to apply to all of the taxa encountered at Cathlapotle. Given these rankings, which are based primarily on size, I examine the degree to which relative prestige designations of two households (Houses 1 and 4) and compartments within one of those households (House 1) are reflected in the spatial distribution of fish remains. I also offer a new method for quantifying sturgeon that utilizes specimen weight to account for differential fragmentation rates while still allowing for sturgeon abundance to be compared to the abundances of other taxa that have been quantified by number of identified specimens (NISP).

Based on remains recovered from 1/4"" mesh screens, comparisons between compartments within House 1 indicate that the chief and possibly other elite members of House 1 likely had some control over the distribution of fish resources within their household, taking more of the preferred sturgeon and salmon, particularly more chinook salmon, for themselves. Comparisons between households provide little evidence to support household-based ownership of fishing sites. A greater abundance of chinook salmon in the higher prestige House 1 may indicate ownership of fishing platforms at major chinook fisheries such as Willamette Falls or Cascades Rapids, but other explanations for this difference between households are possible. Analyses of a limited number of bulk samples, which were included in the study in order to examine utilization of very small fishes, provided insufficient data to allow for meaningful intrasite comparisons. These data indicate that the inhabitants of Cathlapotle were exploiting a broad fish subsistence base that included large numbers of eulachon and stickleback in addition to the larger fishes. This study provides a promising approach for examining prestige on the Northwest Coast and expanding our understanding of the dynamics between social inequality and resource access and control."

This dissertation analyzes these contestations in Pacific Islands climate change diplomacy and governance efforts by asking: i) What do power relations look like among the Pacific Islands' networked organizations? ii) To what authority do organizations appeal to access sources of power? iii) What sources of knowledge are produced and reproduced by these organizations? and iv) How do these patterns fit within the broader history of the Pacific Islands and climate change? I draw from interviews, document analysis, event participation, and social network analysis of Pacific Island climate change diplomacy and governance. This examination leads me to propose the concept of ""Climate Empire,"" which can be understood as the network of knowledge and communicative services that imagine, build, and administer the globe through a decentralized and deterritorialized apparatus of rule.

In the Pacific Islands, Climate Empire upholds technical bureaucratic and scientific approaches to overcoming climate challenges; however, the global spaces in which these approaches are produced are reconnected with the spaces of local resistance through data collection networks and efforts to relocalize knowledge. Thus, the local/global divisions found in diplomacy and governance in the Pacific Islands collectively produce and reform Climate Empire as organizations interact in the network. Further research is necessary to understand the extensiveness of Climate Empire, as well as to ensure the inclusion and empowerment of Pacific Island voices in climate governance for both justice and efficacy."

Approximately 150 indigenous American languages are still spoken in the United States; however, it is estimated that by the year 2050 only twenty of them will remain. Language preservation programs are a part of the struggle for the cultural and economic self-determination of indigenous peoples. These programs often operate within public school systems governed by laws and policies that are linked both with the goals of economic globalization and with basic human rights. This study explored the congruity of these policies, and their impact on indigenous language preservation programs. Its purpose was to provide information that can be used for planning and advocacy for indigenous language preservation programs that reflect the interests and values of indigenous cultural and linguistic communities. The research question addressed by this study was, In what ways do educational standards impact indigenous language preservation efforts? During the process of determining the impact of state policies and standards on language preservation program implementation, the context for the programs and the process of bridging the differences between university research procedures and building relationships with Indian tribes was explored. Using policy documents available online through state department of education websites, the study used intertextual analysis and a set of criteria to evaluate of the degree of alignment of state standards with the national standards movement and with national content standards, and to evaluate the degree to which state education standards are compatible with American Indian language and cultural preservation efforts. States that had policy support for American Indian language preservation programs were those least closely aligned with the national standards movement and grounded their education standards in state needs and values. These states had formal venues for American Indian participation in policy development, gave foreign language credit for American Indian languages, addressed American Indian sovereignty in social studies standards or benchmarks, and included standards on cultural processes."

This research took place over the course of three months within a Nahua indigenous community. I completed fieldwork in both the local elementary school and within the community through participant observation and semi-structured interviews with children, parents, and teachers. What I found was that the ways in which the community constructed childhood, knowledge, and learning differed significantly in what they experienced within the classroom. This in turn effected the relationships that were built between the school and the community and the student’s ability to succeed and have meaningful and supportive educational experiences. The experiences that they have are in turn effected by global, national, and local political and economic trends such as the implementation of neoliberalism, and it subsequent effect on educational policies for rural communities in Mexico. This ultimately leads to an education that is colonial in nature, despite efforts of including bilingual intercultural education programs, as the system seeks to colonize the bodies and minds of these students. Thus, it is my conclusion that both community and school must work together in order to create education programs that decolonize this process through the inclusion of programs that re-center their local language, culture, and learning practices."

Four theoretical approaches are presented and discussed. The first one deals with the social group referred to as peasants. The second one explains the process of economic development at the global level. The third one deals with agroecology and its implications. The fourth and final one refers to ethnicity studies. These four theories are related to the case study of the Indian peasants of Cebadas, Ecuador. These people have experienced and continue to experience processes of economic development and ethnic revitalization, thus providing a good example of how all the theories discussed interplay in a local setting. The element that brings all pieces together is an agroforestry development project carried out in Cebadas by an Ecuadorian non-governmental organization. The rejection by the Indian peasants of the agroecological orientation of the agroforestry project, in the context of the historical and current sociocultural processes of the area represent a choice for a special kind of modernization. The modernization that the Indian peasants want does not create loss of ethnic specificity, but rather reinforces their self-organization and increases their economic opportunities. Results show a relationship between use of exotic tree species and modern technology and the emergence of an incipient Indian ethnic movement."

Chapter One focuses on the movement towards a gender non-specific language through the usage of ‘x’ while also introducing Gloria Anzaldúa’s theory of nepantlas as a space navigated by Latinxs to queer and rewrite dominant understandings of being. Chapter Two looks at the poster art of Julio Salgado and Melanie Cervantes to do an aesthetic analysis of the ways that placing art in the public sphere tells stories that remember indigenous and queer histories. Additionally, by looking at the burlesque performance of Xandra Ibarra and the music videos of Persia and Daddie$ Pla$tik this project provides insight to the ways which resistance against repressive polices (such as the issues of gentrification and border violence) are shifting the political landscape in a way that responsibly acknowledges and centers queer indigenous and Latinx bodies.

Although these stories contributed to the many civil rights organizing and calls for justice that followed, these types of stories have also constructed a particular dominant narrative, which suggests that indigenous people were passive recipients of violence. Using Aurora Levins Morales' concept of ""medicinal histories,"" and Audre Lorde's ""biomythography,"" I construct a layered retelling of the histories and stories of resistance of the Maya -- K'iche', Kaqchikel, and Ixil people that questions and creates a new history/story of the Guatemalan Civil War.

Spiritual discourses attributed to Native Americans, among other groups, are borrowed by Euro-Americans in search of alternatives to dominant ideologies. In such a circumstance, Native Americans become part of a constructed and colonized homogenous category of indigenous people, considered by Euro-Americans as naturally close to the earth and essentially spiritual. The so-called New Age movement has, within it, several sub-movements, which are particularly noted for their emphasis on perceived Native American spiritualism. The Red Cedar Circle, made up primarily of white Americans, focuses on the Si.si.wiss Medicine of the Pacific Northwest Coast, and can be described as falling under the definitional heading of the New Age. The suppression and transformation of the heterogeneous reality of indigenous societies by the imaginings of the Euro-American dominant, has many ethical implications, as does cultural appropriation in a situation of major power differentials. Native communities are becoming increasingly outspoken in their opposition to the practice of Indian, or pseudo-Indian, religions by non-Natives. Many consider such practices to be morally suspect. Both Native and non-Native social critics feel that New Age practitioners involved in appropriated and popularized versions of indigenous religions, are interpreting and using aspects of traditionally subjugated cultures to meet their own needs. What may appear to be a harmless search for enlightenment by Europeans and Euro-Americans might have very real negative consequences for actual Native American lives. This study is based on participant observation of the Corvallis, Oregon Red Cedar Circle, and interviews with its members from June of 1991 to April of 1994. Analysis of data from New Age literature was also conducted, as well as an historical overview of the 'Nobel Savage' myth in Western cultures. Interviews with members of the local Native American community were carried out for feedback on how a given population of Native Americans perceives the Euro-American practice of Native spirituality. The data supports the supposition that cultural borrowing, or appropriation, is both a cause of, and a reaction to, the instability of cultural identity in late twentieth-century America."

(2) How have culture-driven and climate-driven processes contributed to ecosystem change in southwestern Oregon? A brief introduction to the Little River study area is followed by a cultural and ecological history of the watershed. Historical, ecological and archaeological data are used to describe shifts in landscape structure, stand structure and fire behavior. Changes in corridor/patch/matrix relationships, increases in stand densities, and changes in stand age and species structure are documented, and changes in fire dynamics from frequent to infrequent, and small to large are corroborated with descriptive statistics from the nearby 2002 Umpqua Fires. Hypotheses are then proposed to test the relative influence of humans vs. climate on landscape change during Aboriginal (<1820) vs. Euroagrarian (1850-1950) cultural phases. While precipitation shows no correlation with fire frequency or tree recruitment before 1820, significant associations are observed from 1850 to 1950. Moreover, a significant correlation exists between fire frequency and subsequent tree recruitment after 1850, but is not observed during aboriginal times. This suggests that indigenous management fires may have obscured precipitation influences that become apparent only after 1850. In order to test spatial hypotheses concerning the associations between indigenous humans and the landscape, archaeological sites were digitized into a GIS, and ergonomic pathways were modeled between them. These maps are then compared to historically fire-maintained upland meadows interpreted from 1946 aerial photos. A significant spatial correlation was found between archaeological sites and historic meadows, and a highly significant spatial correlation was found between modeled travel networks and historic meadows. The close spatial association between cultural features and fire-maintained habitats again suggests active landscape management by local Indians. These associations are corroborated with historical records. After summarizing the shifts in ecological conditions and describing current conditions, I argue that while restoring the landscape to aboriginal conditions is no longer possible, emulating those conditions within the framework of the Little River Adaptive Management Area Plan can improve the resilience and productivity of the Little River watershed."

There is a need for community college programs that serve Latina/o student populations more effectively and that incorporate multicultural educational practices into college programs. The purpose of this dissertation was to respond to Latina/o community college student needs by suggesting post-colonialist programmatic considerations for the implementation of service learning programs. Using Anzaldúa's (1999) Mestiza consciousness theory, this study analyzed community learning testimonios written by indigenous Latin American cultures and identified common themes applicable to a process of critical consciousness development in social movements as well as (potentially) critical educational programs. The themes common across the four testimonies were (a) collective motivation for learning, (b) organizational dynamics, practices, and values, (c) critical social consciousness, and (d) transcendent communal awareness of identity. This study also contributed to research in this field by exploring qualitative data to build on scholarly understanding of Latina/o students' values and educational goals with an emphasis on critical awareness and service. In the second half of the study, the researcher interviewed Latina/o student participants in a Northwest community college service learning program. Interview questions were guided by post-colonialist theory and themes from the previously analyzed testimonios, and these interviews were analyzed to discover whether any shared elements existed between the indigenous testimonies and the interviews. The researcher did find shared elements that appeared between the testimonies and the service-learning interviews. These shared elements included development of collective identity, critical education, and global social consciousness. At the same time, the researcher also noted that the themes presented differently in the community college context than in Latin American social justice movements. For example, while collective motivation arising from hardship was key in the testimonies, the critical education was most central in the community college setting. Based on these findings, a model was adapted for the development of critical consciousness through social justice service projects that will aid program leaders seeking post-colonialist frameworks for service programs that promote Latina/o student empowerment in the future. Furthermore, the findings and the model may be used by future researchers examining social justice service learning programs. This dissertation includes three standalone manuscripts. The first focused on exploration of literature in Hispanic education, post-colonialist theory, and service learning; the second described the analysis of testimonies and recoded themes from post-colonialist theory that were present in them; and the third detailed a process of interview and analysis that further advanced understanding of the roles of post-colonialist themes and elements from social justice movements in a community college setting."

This thesis examines the relationship and discourse between two Cuicatec towns in Oaxaca, Mexico and three Mexican government agencies within the context of a federally protected and managed biosphere reserve. The Cuicatec people maintain both strong syncretic beliefs of the land that reflect their Prehispanic heritage as well as contemporary and evolving Western perceptions that view a landscape as a set of commodified resources. Through ethnographic interviews, Cuicatec participants shared how federal government resource management affected their traditions, their lives, their subsistence, and their very existence. The power and extent of government discourse from the government agencies varied in both communities thereby affecting both their knowledge and acceptance of the government resource management policies. Cuicatec participants emphasized the need for greater direct government communication coupled with financial support to meet their socioeconomic challenges that are further exacerbated by federal restrictions on both traditional and commercial resource use. New identities are being forged as government discourse begins to promote ecotourism in the communities as way of alleviating the socioeconomic challenges. Continuing research in the region will be useful to trace the development of new community subjectivities as well as the socioeconomic effects of future tourism development in the communities."

Bilinguality as a positive factor Is considered in the florescence and duration of the central lowland Mayan area. The impact of Spanish language on indigenous languages of Mesoamerica is traced from 1519 to the present.

On the Warm Springs reservation of Oregon, the Culture and Heritage department, the tribal agency in charge of language preservation, is offering instruction in all three languages of the reservation: Wasco, Sahaptin and Northern Paiute. Most of the class offerings target the children of the tribes. In an effort to stimulate their interest, Culture and Heritage has considered creating language learning computer games. During a ten-week internship with Culture and Heritage in the spring of 1999, I did preliminary research for a Wasco computer game. Using participant observation and informal interviews with children, elders and Warm Springs Elementary School teachers, I developed a possible structure and scenario for a game centered on traditional subsistence activities. I also identified obstacles to the realization of language computer games, such as lack of technological resources in Warm Springs, and elders' resistance to computers. Results and recommendations were issued in a public meeting in Warm Springs and presented in a report. This thesis is a case study exploring in greater depth issues that arose during my internship, like the politics of anthropological fieldwork on reservations, and issues related to the Wasco computer game project, such as the pragmatics of language preservation and the role of computers in reversing language shift. On the latter, it was found that the introduction of computers tends to disrupt traditional hierarchies and patterns for the transmission of knowledge. In view of the cultural, financial and logistic costs, the benefits of Computer Assisted Language Learning for the preservation of severely endangered languages are uncertain at best."

Mexico was in the midst of unprecedented prosperity. The world's oldest ruling political party, Mexico's PRI, enjoyed substantial support. Allegations of corruption within an authoritarian regime were now frivolous charges obscured by economic success. The nation was poised to become a major player in the global market; vying with Japan to be the second largest trading partner of the U.S.A. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, the largest trading partner of the U.S., Mexico and the United States became effective January 1, 1994. Just after midnight 1994, the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) went to war in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. Approximately 2500 peasants (mostly indigenous men of Mayan descent) had mobilized against the Mexican government. The violence sparked world wide interest in the human rights of Mexican Indians. Ten days later, as the EZLN retreated into the jungle, an international audience remained captivated by the struggle. The Mexican Army did not advance. The EZLN refused to lay down its arms. Within the year, the Mexican economy collapsed. Soon thereafter, President Salinas went into voluntary exile amidst charges of high crimes against the state. Was it just a coincidence that the rebellion coincided with the implementation of NAFTA? Did the treaty really present such an enormous threat to Mexico's underclass? Did NAFTA contribute to the nation's political problems? The following thesis answers these questions. It is the product of years of travel and study throughout Chiapas and Mexico, both before and after the rebellion. The intricacies of the relationship between NAFTA, the Mexican government and the EZLN are revealed. The government's position and rebel demands are reconcilable. This is an important conclusion. But Mexico is a poor country embroiled in a rebellion to the south as well as a precarious economic treaty with the world's wealthiest nation to the north. In addition, the EZLN has come to represent the world's beleaguered poor in an era of free trade. As Mexico's past and present are explored, conclusions about the country's future have implications that go beyond NAFTA."

One of these dynamics is based on the discrimination they receive, not only from Anglo-Americans, but also mainstreamed Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. Their vulnerability is partly due to language and cultural differences.By exploring their experiences and subjectively capturing nine individual’s stories of migration, my intent is to make direct and indirect comparisons of how global socio-economic forces impact communities that until recently were self-sufficient and autonomous. Their stories are not much different than those of their counterparts who, because of economic factors, are force to immigrate or face permanent economic destitution. The Mixteco subjects’ lives and trials serve as witnesses to help explain the intricate web of micro-events, which collectively influence and respond (most negatively) to macro events of which we are now witnessing as the planet’s population polarizes between the haves and have nots.

The problem with acculturation theory is that it is filled with teleological and quantitative assumptions of purity or authenticity which often fail to explain that the process of adapting to a dominant culture is seldom done in a consistent logical progression. While many people undergoing culture change are faced with problems of communication that force them to make sense out of new discursive formations that exhibit new systems of cultural management, deviations from the invariant aspects of traditions are dependent upon how subjects have interpreted and given meaning to changes which have occurred in their environment rather than upon a mechanical assignation of cultural traits. This thesis seeks to better understand the nature and universal characteristics that embody ritual and religion through an ethnographic and historical investigation of two religious festivals that annually occur in a remote province located in the eastern valleys of Bolivia. Christian feast days in accordance with the Catholic calendar are predominant modes of ceremonial expression in the Latin American religious universe. In both the festivals that this thesis documents, ritual modes of exchange with divine figures/objects evidence forms of religious syncretism and the superimposition of Catholicism over Andean traditions. Using ethno-historical methods of documentation, this study shows the process of how meaning has been transformed from native Andean religious institutions and cultural practices to Spanish institutions largely influenced by Roman Catholicism. My research also confirms that while religious syncretism exists in both festivals, contrasting elements of orthodoxy against more idiosyncratic practices found in the festivals reveal two levels of Catholicism and the development of a more localized form of religious celebration detached from the church universal, a trend which also parallels religious developments in 16th century Spain."

Black-Queer, Indigenous Feminisms, and Two-spirit critiques make explicit the roots of white supremacist policies that attempt to keep our communities in a perpetual state of oppression through racist health educational, and environmental policies and practices. Our knowledge frameworks expand the intersections of our identities to include other than human relatives, nationhood, and spirituality that is territorially specific to our tribal nations, urban communities, and the lands where we live.

It details the Black and indigenous legacy of dependency in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries on foreign industry and development in Bocas del Toro, and the cultural and socioeconomic context in which these issues are situated. The findings of this dissertation provide an analysis of education barriers in an Afro-Caribbean island community living on Isla Bastimentos and an indigenous (Ngäbe) community living on Isla San Cristóbal. The analysis details the local perceptions of community/computer centers, the implications of computer access, and suggests potential technology-based solutions to overcome education barriers. In addition, the study highlights digital literacy and develops a unique theoretical framework that combines a capabilities approach and an aspirations-based approach for technology-based development. Overall, this dissertation offers a holistic analysis of the impacts and implications of development and technology on Black and indigenous people in Bocas del Toro that provides a foundation for similar future applied research in Latin America and the Caribbean, and across the globe."

IK is essential to Indigenous people due to its Place-based approach built upon generations of ancestral relational observations between the environment and the living (Berkes, 1993). A term that may be familiar to Western Scientists and used in Academia instead of IK or TEK is Nature-based Solutions (NbS). However, NbS implementation can ignore local/generational and Place-based knowledge from stakeholders such as Indigenous People. One major problem with NbS is the mindset that if the solution worked in one place, it should also work in another. IK does not function in that manner; it is specific to a place and a people. The two studies for the thesis focus on Indigenous Knowledge in two unique manners. The first is a semi-structured interview with generational bean-growing Campesinos and the impact on their IK due to climate change. This study, through first-hand interviews of generational Campesinos, sought to answer 1) whether Campesinos have felt the impact of climate change in bean production, 2) how bean-related IK is affected by climate change and society, and 3) to determine what Campesinos need to produce beans in the face of adverse conditions. Eight primary questions were developed with Dr. Dominique Bachelet, the Food and Climate Change FST555 professor at Oregon State University. The researcher, with a local guide, successfully interviewed Campesinos. They provided clear evidence of IK no longer being applicable due to climate change. The second paper was a literature review of Indigenous Knowledge in Tajikistan. The author highlighted the region because there is a possibility of conducting research in Tajikistan and wanted to understand previous research conducted in the region. It also appeared to be an excellent opportunity for understanding the impact of Soviet rule on Indigenous Knowledge. The research was conducted by searching Google Scholar for all references to the phrases “Tajikistan” and “Traditional Ecological Knowledge.” The two phrases were selected because any relevant study would include the nation's name, and the phrase because the Academia/Western Science are familiar with the term versus Indigenous Knowledge. The study assessed nine components of IK and reviewed if and how the components were utilized. The paper's primary questions were to determine the number of studies that capture the essence of environmental/agricultural IK, 2) the geographic areas of Tajikistan where studies were conducted, and 3) identify Indigenous groups (included and excluded)."

The introduction provides context to help situate my articles within the current environmental movement. In my first article, “Constellating a More Intersectional, Coalitional Rhetoric: Lessons from Standing Rock,” I advocate for approaching coalitions and their rhetoric through the lens of constellations in order to create more intersectional, coalitional rhetoric. In this paper, I expand upon Leanne Betasamosake Simpson’s (Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg) concept of constellations and apply it to coalitional statements created at the peak of the protests at Standing Rock against the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016. Ultimately, I argue that a constellative approach to coalitions and their rhetoric can allow for more intersectional and coalitional rhetoric to emerge. We will know when coalitions have approached their work in a constellative way when we observe their rhetoric centering the voices of frontline communities and Indigenous people. While my first article advocates for a theoretical approach to coalitional rhetoric, my second article, “Frontline Leadership, Privileged Capacity: Understanding the Rhetoric of the Portland Clean Energy Fund,” continues the thread of analyzing coalitional rhetoric by examining the messaging of the Portland Clean Energy Fund (PCEF) through seven interviews conducted over the span of twelve months with six different activists in the Portland environmental movement. In this article, I explore how the guiding principle of the PCEF coalition, “frontline leadership, privileged capacity,” led not only to more inclusive and intersectional organizing, but also inclusive and intersectional rhetoric. Together, these articles provide both a theoretical framework and case study analysis of how coalitions composed of power asymmetries within the environmental movement can become more intersectional and inclusive in practice and create more intersectional and inclusive rhetoric."

Sovereign rights holders are senior appropriators within reservations and ceded lands as promised in treaties. The purpose of this research is to consider the lengthy litigation history of Indigenous Tribes and Nations, government-to-government relations, regional intergovernmental relations, and participatory collaborative governance as a means to reduce legal response and continue toward acknowledging Indigenous rights and sovereignty. This case study utilizes Leach et al’s (2002) framework for evaluating collaborative success in watershed management applied to the 2018 Stream Flow Restoration Act’s Watershed Enhancement and Restoration Plan in WRIA 7, Washington. Information was collected from monthly planning and technical unit meetings from 2018-2021, final watershed draft plans, personal communication and grant funding documents from 2019-2024. This study affirms WRIA 7 stakeholders, including the Indigenous governments with rights therein, have an existing collaborative relationship in water resources through salmon recovery efforts which Indigenous governments are regularly active. While these long-standing planning efforts strengthened the Acts planning group functions, the Act lacked comprehensive accountability by excluding adaptive management which is a key element of long-term planning that would have provided a level of certainty for participants. The state’s inability to address these uncertainties left sovereign rights holders unable to adopt the final plan and ultimately eroded government-to government relations by lacking two-tier consultations during the process. Within the planning process, two (18%) of 11 water offset projects were sponsored by Indigenous governments and seven (26%) of 27 habitat projects were Indigenous sponsored. For funded projects, four applicants were local governments of which one (25%) was funded. Four applicants were from Indigenous governments of which two (50%) were funded. The capacity for regional collaborative watershed governance also appeared to increase in which the planning group went beyond the minimum planning declarations by including policy reforms, which were self-initiated and led by Indigenous governments (50%). Without a stakeholder consensus, the plan was not adopted and is currently in final development by the state."

This dissertation answers calls to remember and historicize the victims of the Guatemalan Civil War and joins other calls from women of color feminists and cultural rhetorics to decenter white, Western, U.S.-based histories and methodologies by piecing and weaving together remnants of stories that imagine queer, trans, mixed-race Maya people as always already part of these histories (CRTL 2014, Hull et.al. 2015, Anzaldúa and Moraga 1983, Pérez 1999). The Maya-centered queer/trans rhetorical methodology I use throughout argues for a historicizing practice centered on Indigenous sovereignty and locally specific Indigenous paradigms and frameworks to stop the erasure of Indigenous peoples from collective consciousness and canons."

Alaska is a highly rural state with a distinct cultural and geographical landscape which translates into unique needs for students pursuing higher education in this environment. Through a review of literature, it is evident that although research into rurality in higher education is increasing, understanding its intersection with other identities which may be marginalized is still emerging. Engaging intersectionality theory as a basis for understanding how marginalized identities may intersect, this study utilizes a framework based on extant retention models, research on rural college students, and research on Indigenous college students. A logistic regression model was generated utilizing institutional data from a small college in Alaska. Data included demographic, pre-college, and college variables entered in forward stepwise blocks. A significant model was generated, however interactions between geography and race and geography and gender did not significantly contribute to the model. Non-significant findings suggest the need to further disaggregate data and include additional variables that have been found to be predictive of retention in previous studies. Nonsignificant findings also suggest a possible level of efficacy at serving rural and Indigenous students at this institution. In a discussion, strategies for continuing to improve institutional environments to support students with intersecting marginalized identities, particularly rural, Indigenous students are explored."

In her work, she composes mirrored poems in Isthmus Zapotec and Spanish. I analyze the ways in which her work brings Zapotec and Spanish into contact with one another, demanding that readers acknowledge narratives of erasure that denigrate indigenous language, voice, and cultural expression. In the thesis, I argue that Pineda Santiago’s work can be described as a “bleeding assemblage” or a network of permeable relations. Through this model, I theorize that the work occupies, redefines, and expands a host of contact zones. I further conceptualize Pineda Santiago as a poet-translator, such that her poetry offers an alternative model of relationality that is transcontextual, transnational, translingual, and transformative. I propose that her work demonstrates the powerful ability of language and poetry to cross, blur, and deconstruct a binary notion of borders and turn such divides into contact zones where both connection and division, similarity and difference, pain and joy might co-exist. Through this thesis, I propose that Pineda Santiago’s poetry demonstrates a new form of relationality that rewrites cultural mythologies of violence and erasure."

Local communities both impact and are affected by the creation of MPAs and as such, it is important to include their knowledge and perspectives in the process of creating a MPA. Scholars are calling for analyses of knowledge and power in ocean governance and its consequent effects on marginalized voices. Using political ecology as a framework in this study provides the foundation to understand how the political, economic, and social power dynamics shape access and control over marine landscapes. The first Indigenous-led proposal for a marine sanctuary within the U.S. was made in 2015 by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council in California. Using the current unfolding case of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) in California, this thesis aims to understand the mechanisms for including community voices in the sanctuary designation process as well as how those voices share knowledge and shape the broader communities’ understanding of this process. This research advances the literature on political ecology in marine contexts because by framing arguments about MPAs in terms of knowledge claims and connecting formal and informal institutions in this process, I am able to analyze how power is distributed in the governance of MPAs, but also how power dynamics influence the formation of MPAs and who is included (or not) in these processes. This study asks whose knowledge claims are used in MPA creation, how people are included in the designation process and how community led initiatives share and spread knowledge. Findings are generated from thematic analysis of 1,276 public comments and 20 semi-structured interviews conducted with a range of stakeholders and rightsholders along the central California coast. The findings reveal that the broader social, economic, and political climates are strong influencers in who is included in the process, why decisions are made, and for whom sanctuaries are designated. Furthermore, this study identified barriers to people’s involvement in the designation process, which are shaped by systemic and structural inequalities. Coalitions were found to be the central way organizations shared knowledge and resources, increasing the capacity of the individuals and organizations within them. This study improves our understanding of how knowledge is tied to power in the governance of MPAs and how power dynamics influence who is included in creating them. The findings emphasize the need for NOAA to rebuild broken relationships with stakeholders and provide funding and resources for communities wanting to nominate a sanctuary. These findings also shed light on the impacts of settler colonialism and how it influences Indigenous-led marine conservation efforts."

This study also concerns the importance of these plants that are also utilized by elk living within the Ceded Lands of the PGST. We review issues of colonialism and its process of taking lands, removing Indigenous peoples from their traditional landscapes, resources, identities, and Traditional Sciences. We review the history of the PGST and community and their strength and survival, as the “Strong People.” We use a metaphor of weaving throughout this study and work to educate and remove the strands of colonialism while reinserting the strands of Traditional Knowledge and Indigenous Sciences back into the weaving. The weaving represents the traditional practices of resource management developed over many millennia by PGST. We also review the challenges faced by Tribal Nations in the face of Settler Colonialism and capitalist greed, which are the leading cause of climatic changes and collapse of resources. The spread of Western science across the globe, including the colonization, genocide, and forced removals of Indigenous peoples is also examined. We discuss the importance of Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and its leading role in finding ways to help calm changes happening globally. We examine differences and similarities of Traditional Ecological Sciences and Western scientific methods, and explain how the two sciences can complement each other to find ways of creating a world that will serve the next seven generations by implementing “Two Eyed Seeing” and building a world that is responsible and reciprocal. Elders of the PGST expressed concerns about the disappearance of culturally important plants in traditional gathering areas because of numerous factors including climate change. During formal interviews and informal conversations, PGST Elders repeatedly mentioned plants of KCS in traditional ancestral gathering areas are scarce and rarely found in contemporary times. Some gathering locations for KCS plants are no longer accessible due to privatization of lands that were available in the past. Five species were identified as most scarce by Elders. Elders suggested several reasons for the decline in availability of plants, including habitat changes, development, and climate change. Our narrative is designed in two threads, where plants of KCS are one focus and Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) grazing habitat are the other thread of locating plants of KCS. Both elk and women gather the same plants. We searched for the plants of KCS to catalogue and document their abundance or lack thereof in first traditional gathering locations and second within the Ceded Lands as lead by Elder knowledge. From 2014 to 2018 plants were recorded in plots and declined steadily either due to human-caused change or warming and canopy removal, with an exception of an old growth cedar forest that maintained its integrity over time. Prince’s Pine (Chimaphila umbellate (L) was highly abundant (60% cover) in Fall and Spring of 2015 and steadily declined to 20% and 0% in Spring and Fall of 2018, respectively. Devils Club (Opolpanax horridus (Sm.) Miq.) in a gathering location that was separated by a roadway had 80% and 90% cover on the west and east sides of the roadway in 2015 and declined to 0% and 20% by 2018, respectively. A clearcut had occurred on the east side of the roadway. Climate change analysis and vegetation surveys suggest that freshwater wetlands are decreasing within the three counties where plants of KCS are located. Freshwater wetlands are decreasing by 4.8% in Kitsap County, 0.7% in Clallam County and 1.9% in Jefferson County based on landscape changes between 1996 and 2010. Climate change scenarios for Ceded Lands of the Point No Point Treaty Council (PNPTC) suggest that drying vegetation was most pronounced on eastern and northern borders, and suggests that warming in the 21st century will result in slightly wetter spring and fall seasons with dryer summers. These results create a concern that within a few years many of the plants of KCS will be sparse and even more difficult to find. Many of these plants may survive in a greenhouse or some kind of managed forested locations with similar soil and nutrient traits. We examined potential anthropogenic factors influencing movement of non-migratory Roosevelt elk, within the Ceded Lands managed by the PNPTC. Elk are found in Game Management Unit (GMU) 621, which is one of several GMUs located in PGST Ceded Lands. The threads of traditional ways are supported by adaptive Western scientific processes that link Elders and subsistence gatherers via telemetry locations where subsistence plants may be found. Elk gather similar or identical plants of KCS, creating a partnership of traditional and contemporary scientific processes and connectivity. Year-round, elk primarily use shrub/scrub (27.3% use), grasslands (23.6%), evergreen forests (16.5%) and mixed forested (12.7%), and use pasture hay (0.2%), the least. Seasonal powerline use was higher in fall (15.5%) and winter (20.3%) than spring (6.6%) and summer (9.2%). Calving areas were located in both north and south parts of GMU 621 and elk groups were separate from each other in fall and winter within north and south regions of the Duckabush Estuary. Elk are part of the ancestral first foods and Elders and members of the PGST Hunting Committee are concerned about the decline of elk in this region as they do not appear to migrate. The PGST Hunting Committee manages elk in this area along with the State of Washington to ensure they are not over-hunted as occurred in the past. Our study identified numerous problems concerning the ability of PGST Elders to gather plants of KCS. The greatest problems in the near term are the privatization of traditional gathering areas preventing access to plants, and human-driven habitat changes (development and land use) that make the remaining areas less suitable for plant species. The long-term threat of climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems and sea level rise may inundate wetlands that are important gathering areas. The PGST may want to create community science programs allowing access to plants of KCS within privatized landscapes for Elders and also assist to monitor elk as they move in and out of private lands. The PGST may work with the Federal Government and the State of Washington creating policy changes giving more access or granting land back for subsistence gathering (flora and fauna) outside of current PGST Treaty land boundaries."

This thesis enters that impasse to suggest a decolonial option for criticism that rewrites modes of reading and critiquing through knowledges that emerge from across the colonial difference, and specifically from indigenous perspectives. The trickster discourse and the aestheSic practice of beadwork, as laid out through the literary exempla of Leslie Marmon Silko’s Almanac of the Dead and Beth Piatote’s The Beadworkers, present decolonial models for criticism where the objective is to write against the domination of the modern/colonial world and posit alternative modes of and knowledges about being with/in the world. This thesis contends that the decolonial option not only bypasses the impasses of neoliberalism but also encourages the healing of colonized people from the colonial wound."

Research questions were developed collaboratively and were designed to address a common management conundrum in the Willamette Valley, which is how to diminish shrub encroachment and sustain high native plant diversity while minimizing herbicide use. In the study, three management tools – ecological burning, mowing, and targeted goat and sheep herbivory – are applied at a 29-acre Tribally owned oak savanna. After two years of data collection – “before” conditions in 2023 and “after” conditions in 2024 – I analyze the impacts of each management activity on species richness and the cover of all shrubs, particular shrub genera, annual grasses, and native perennial forbs. Study results show a moderate degree of effectiveness for all three management actions in reducing shrub cover, with different effects depending on the shrub genus. Ecological burning caused a slight set back to nonnative annual grasses while increasing native perennial forb cover, while mowing caused the greatest increase in non-native annual grasses, although this trend was inconsistent across blocks. Since a small dataset and only one year of management treatments resulted in a high degree of variability in the data, longer-term data collection and different combinations of management actions are recommended moving forward. This study is offered as a model for how social institutions can effectively work together to plan, act, monitor, and evaluate land management strategies. Because Willamette Valley grassland ecosystems co-evolved with active interaction by Indigenous communities, the restoration of human-land connection is essential for long-term ecosystem resilience. Approaching Willamette Valley grasslands as a socioecological system is recommended to ensure that these critical habitats, with the many ecological and cultural values they support, will persist long into the future."

This loss of forest and fire resilience leads to a loss of social resilience as forested communities struggle to adapt to an intensifying fire regime. Across scales, the term resilience has served as a policy goal for federal agencies and place-based forest collaboratives over the last decade. While a useful metaphor for environmental change, resilience outcomes may be unevenly distributed across a landscape or a community. When we add an equity lens to the concept of resilience, we see that resilience is situated and experienced differently by different communities based on social, political, or ecological context. Marginalized and historically under-voiced groups often bear the effects of wildland fire disturbance disproportionately and provide unique insight into conceptions of community resilience to wildfire. Relying on a critical examination of resilience, this research uses a qualitative approach to identify attributes of community resilience to wildfire specific to the Rogue River Basin of southwest Oregon. This research also provides a deeper understanding of the role of regional-scale forest collaboratives in impacting both resilience and equity in resilience in this region. Attributes of resilience, as identified in this research, are actions or processes that impact the Rogue Basin social-ecological system. In positioning attributes within equity and resilience frameworks, I found that actions taken to adapt and transform systems toward community resilience to wildfire present opportunities to address social inequities through recognition of diverse knowledge, inclusion in forest governance, and ultimately how resilience was felt across the Rogue Basin. Regional-scale forest collaboratives played a crucial role in shaping both equity and resilience through intentional recruitment of and support for diverse knowledge holders in collaborative membership, consideration of accessibility and capability in forest governance procedures, and thoughtful allocation of collaborative funding and collaboratively designed restoration treatments. This research has implications for communities of place in the Rogue Basin, where community members may gain deeper understanding of diverse paths and experiences of resilience. Moreover, this research broadens the scope of understanding of community resilience to wildfire where organizations working at the intersection of community and forest resilience may gain a deeper understanding of broader efforts to support communities in adapting to, recovering from and preparing for wildfire."

Despite the limited presence of fossil fuel infrastructure in the state, however, the industry is actively pursuing permits for two highly controversial developments: The Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline and the Jordan Cove Export Terminal. The pipeline would connect with the existing Ruby Pipeline in Malin, Oregon, pass through 229-miles of southwestern Oregon’s tribal, forest, and agricultural lands while traversing over 400 streams and rivers, and terminate on the coast of Oregon in Coos Bay where the gas will be liquefied and refined prior to exportation to overseas markets. Over 600 private landowners are threatened with eminent domain, and the ancestral territories, cultural resources, and burial grounds of five Oregon and three northern California federally recognized tribes would also be impacted by this project. The purpose of this master’s thesis research was three-fold: 1) to explore the negative impacts of the LNG supply chain; 2) to conduct an ethnographic study of communities and organizations within the affected zones of the LNG project in order to understand how they perceive the risks they face, and 3) to highlight how these same communities are forging intersectional alliances to assert their opposition to the development. This study identifies the environmental, cultural, and social threats of the pipeline and terminal using the conceptual frameworks of environmental justice, settler colonialism, and the anthropology of energy and extraction. Additionally, it explores the connection between human rights, environmental protection, and the conservation of cultural keystone species that are often threatened by large-scale fossil fuel development."
os41,Bridging Ways of Knowing to Model the Dynamics of Fire as an Ecocultural Process on Frequent Fire Landscapes of the Pacific Northwest,Skye M. Greenler,2022,Dissertation,Sustainable Forest Management ,,Oregon State University,,https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/hm50v038h?locale=en,record,44.56187847,-123.2822886,Text,"Wildfire impacts have intensified in many ecosystems across the western United States due to the combined impact of fire exclusion, climate change, and land management practices. However, on many of these landscapes, fire is a fundamental ecological process that has shaped vegetation structural and compositional diversity, ecosystem function, landscape pattern, resource availability, and disturbance dynamics for millennia. Interacting Indigenous and lightning ignitions resulted in complex feedbacks across these landscapes influenced by biophysical settings, topoedaphic variability, Indigenous stewardship practices and land use patterns, and lightning density and spatial distribution. Following over a century of fire exclusion in the western United States, increasing trends in wildfire activity stem, at least in part, from a breakdown of the patterns and processes that historically maintained fire-adapted systems. While scientists and managers often discuss fire as an ecosystem or ecocultural process, most current research and management only considers single fire events. In this dissertation, I used transdisciplinary methods and simulation modeling to explore the connections between the role of fire as an ecocultural process and the management and stewardship of contemporary fire-prone landscapes. The broad objectives for this work were to: 1) assess the degree to which contemporary fires can restore historical conditions in dry forests of eastern Oregon; 2) model the location and timing of cultural ignitions for a large landscape in the California western Klamath Mountains; 3) develop a set of detailed state and transition models to describe vegetation succession and disturbance in the western Klamath Mountains; and 4) estimate current landscape departure from historical conditions in the Klamath Mountains study area. I first assessed the degree to which individual fires can restore forested systems given departure from historical processes then I transitioned into a deeper exploration of these processes and development of tools and understanding to facilitate future modeling of fire as an ecocultural process in northern California. In chapter two, I explored the potential for single fires to restore historical forest conditions in dry forests of eastern Oregon using a novel, multi-step modeling framework to predict the range of fire severities most likely to restore historical forest basal area, density, and species composition. Through this modeling, I demonstrated that restoration of historical basal area and density can be achieved by a relatively narrow range of moderate-severity fire, however forest composition cannot be restored by a single fire. Restorative fire severity ranges for stand basal area and density were quite similar for ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forest types, in part due to the relatively high fire tolerance of large-diameter grand (Abies grandis) and white fir (Abies concolor) that established following fire exclusion. These results suggest that the forest conditions that developed under recurrent fire cannot easily be restored by fire alone and multiple or more precise treatments will be required to restore species composition. In chapter three, I worked in partnership with the Karuk Tribe to develop a transdisciplinary model to simulate annual cultural ignition locations and timings across a 260,000-ha landscape in the western Klamath Mountains. This modeling demonstrated the extensive influence of cultural burning across the landscape and produced estimates in alignment with historical estimates of Indigenous populations, fire history studies, early descriptions of landscape conditions, and estimates of pre-colonization landscape structure and composition. The modeled ignition locations and timings are distinct from the spatial and temporal distribution of lightning ignitions demonstrating their important contribution to landscape vegetation patterns and eco-cultural processes. In chapter four, I developed a detailed set of state and transition model (STM) pathway groups to represent vegetation and fuel conditions following fires of varying severity, reburns, and succession in the absence of fire for five major vegetation types in the western Klamath Mountains. The STMs are approximations of states that would exist on the landscape under an active fire regime. However, many of the states are heavily influenced by recurrent fire and no longer exist on the current landscape given the underlying fire processes that supported their persistence have been disrupted. These STMs were developed as part of a larger project to model vegetation and fuel dynamics, wildfire risk, and landscape structure under varying management scenarios and recurrent fire using the REBURN fire simulation framework. In chapter five, I used the LANDFIRE state and transition simulation framework to assess overall landscape departure from historical conditions and the development and maintenance of woodland conditions under varying fire regimes for the northern California study area. I demonstrated substantial departure from historical conditions for all major vegetation types on the landscape with open late, successional vegetation showing the largest decrease. Detailed modeling for mixed evergreen forests suggested that, historically, woodlands accounted for approximately 20% of this vegetation type, much of which was within the open, late successional forests that are nearly absent from the landscape today. Overall, the studies conducted as part of this dissertation demonstrate the need to incorporate and consider ecocultural fire processes in restoration planning and fire management of fire prone forests in the Pacific Northwest. This research suggests that, on contemporary landscapes, the strong linkages between landscape vegetation patterns, fire processes, and disturbances have eroded substantially and reintroduction of fire alone is unlikely to readily restore these key connections. Further, this work demonstrates that in northern California, and likely elsewhere, Indigenous fire stewardship is a key component of restoring fire processes, ecosystem functioning, and desired resources."

In the first manuscript, the researcher examines his journey of using cultural resilience strategies to succeed in the education system on the Diné reservation and in urban cities. He also details the development of his cultural and professional identities. Four cultural resilient strategies are reflected in his story: 1) familial support, 2) cultural teachings, 3) spirituality, and 4) sacred Diné terms. In the second manuscript, 15 Diné elementary teachers’ perspectives on Diné-centered education are explored through the use of interviews and questionnaires. The findings indicate: 1) ambivalent support among stakeholders on the teachings of Diné language, culture, and history, 2) improving students’ test scores on statewide assessments as the dominant curricular perspective, 3) curricular challenges in implementing Diné-based education, and 4) a need to train teachers on culturally responsive teaching and learning strategies.In the third manuscript, the author reflects on the challenges of negotiating the demands of two IRBs, representing two very different cultures. Three key observations are generated. First, the IRB review and approval processes between the university and tribal IRBs were recursive which excessively delayed the author’s research project. Second, the university IRB requested original and modified documents of Navajo Nation IRB protocol, consent form, and approval letter, which also served to delay the research; similarly, the Navajo IRB required its own body of permits, letters of support, and public testimony as part of the process. Third, the Navajo tribe is a sovereign government that exercises its own IRB regulations (e.g. Principal Investigator designation and ownership of research materials) which at times, conflicted with university (i.e., federal) IRB guidelines. Overall, the three manuscripts provide description and new questions to an area of inquiry that has been on the margins of educational research: the experience of Navajo teachers in the age of the Common Core and other manifestations of education standardization."

The theory being tested was that ""The knowledge gathered by Tribal members was significantly altered by the influence of Western societal beliefs and land reductions."" Confederated Tribes of Siletz tribal members older than eighteen years of age were interviewed, and these interviews were analyzed. Identification of tribal members' information, experience, and corroboration with Western scientific validation was examined and illustrated the validity of juxtaposing TEK application and information with existing Western scientific methods. Tribal members' utilization of TEK showed a routinely employed system of identification as well as selective collection and natural management of resources for future replenishment based on natural ecological patterns and behaviors rather than Western scientific principles. The conclusion of this research effort was that the system of TEK has been employed in a predictable and consistent manner that operates in relation to the environment and gathering information from environmental changes, reflecting human adaptation rather than Western scientific ideology."

From organic agriculture, to Slow Food, Locavore, and the Food Sovereignty movement, people around the world are reasserting their right to healthy and culturally appropriate food grown using ecologically sound practices. These movements are guided in part by different philosophical and practical approaches to agricultural production and food consumption. The purpose of this inquiry is to explore the relationship between alternative agrifood movements and industrialized agricultural, including their socio-cultural, economic, and ecological outcomes. I focus this inquiry on a case study in the Ecuadorian Andes at an organic farm, La Finca, and a local NGO, Ser Tierra, both of which are involved in the alternative food movement. Specifically, I sought to gain an overview of community-supported agriculture (CSA) initiatives implemented at the local level by La Finca, and to determine whether or not these initiatives could be adapted to support the efforts of women farmer's working with the NGO, and 2) to learn about local women farmers' food sovereignty and micro-credit programs offered by Ser Tierra. Although I recognize that there are other (and sometimes contradictory) interpretations, this body of research contends that industrialized agriculture is in a state of over-development, and that alternative agrifood movements (such as the La Finca organic farm and Ser Tierra farmer field schools) represent more than niche-marketing, but rather a real commitment to environmental sustainability and socio-economic justice. This argument is based on data that illustrate that 1) the ecological effects of industrialized agriculture are overwhelmingly destructive, with increased loss of biodiversity worldwide, whereas small-scale agricultural practices promote healthy soil and biodiversity, 2) the economic benefits of large-scale agriculture are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few multinational corporations, while the livelihoods of many of the world's small-scale farmers are simultaneously destroyed, and 3) the socio-cultural impact of industrialized agriculture is a loss of traditional foods and a trend towards global food hegemony controlled by multinational agrifood complexes, rather than by individual or local cultural preferences."

This emergent concept has sparked conversation but has not yet been implemented at scale. Amidst increasing movement toward both collaborative decision-making and more meaningful tribal partnerships on federal forestlands, my research asked 1) why the Anchor Forest concept emerged and how it could be used in the future, and 2) how its narratives reinforce or depart from mainstream media narratives about tribal partnerships in forest management. From my constructivist and critical research paradigm, I explored these questions through the perspectives of those closely involved in Anchor Forests and aimed to conduct research that would further the ITC’s work. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews and documents shows how Anchor Forests would expand spatial and temporal scales of forest governance and management, and why tribal leadership could overcome barriers that have blocked this scale expansion in the past. Results suggest institutional and individual-level shifts are needed in federal land management agencies to enable effective cross-boundary partnerships with tribes, and Anchor Forests could serve as a conceptual tool to build momentum for these shifts. I found that media coverage of tribal forestry sometimes portrays tribes as victims or as powerless, depending on context and framing, whereas Anchor Forest narratives depict tribes as powerful and capable. This suggests communicating Anchor Forest narratives could shift these portrayals and create a better starting place for meaningful partnerships. My research contributes to theoretical literature on tribal involvement in collaborative and cross-boundary forest management, and results will be communicated directly to the ITC and partners to support future outreach on Anchor Forests."

Counselors are tasked with understanding multiculturalism from self-awareness to clients’ worldviews to larger implications on society and culture. Culture and language are intertwined; therefore, it is critical for counselors to develop knowledge in culturally specific language as it informs culture. Limited research explores language usage among Native American cultures, especially in how this interacts with early childhood development. Children’s books act as a mirror to a child’s lived experience or as a window into another cultural perspective. Specifically, Native American authored children’s books serve as a mirror for both Native American children’s lived experience and Native American cultural perspective. For counselors, Native American authored children’s books are windows to gain insight into Native American children’s worldviews. This manuscript dissertation utilized corpus linguistics to examine different aspects of language in Native American authored children’s books. The first study explored the psycholinguistic properties of Native American authored children’s books. Linguistic properties included pronoun usage and terms related to family, and psychological processes included language associated with emotion, relativity, and indicators of confidence in authorship. The Native American authored children’s books were then compared to non-Native American authored books. Results indicate that Native American authored children’s books utilize the linguistic features of first-person singular pronouns and relativity most frequency. A comparison between Native American authored books versus non-Native American authored children’s books indicated no significant difference in psycholinguistic properties. Within such results, however, there was indication of higher frequency of first-person plural pronoun usage in Native American authored children’s books. The second study researched code-switching (CS), the transversing between languages within and in between sentences of Native American authored children’s books, as well as in comparison with non-Native American children’s books and Latino authored children’s books. CS was measured by usage of trigrams composed of three-word tokens in which at least one word was written in a different language. Results from this study demonstrate CS occurs within Native American authored books at a higher frequency when compared to non-Native authored children’s books and at a lower frequency when compared to Latino authored books. The implications of both studies encourage counselors to utilize Native American authored children’s books to support cultural and personal identity development as well as to prevent or repair cultural ruptures. The studies also highlight the need for additional research in the overall impact of cultural language development with attachment development, as well as impacts based on tribal-specific cultural identity and personal development."

Application of this research has resulted in myriad forms of tourism, two of these being ecotourism and educational travel. Ecotourism represents a response to what is the destructive nature of the mass tourism industry and its damage to host communities' social, economic and environmental systems. Educational travel is an attempt to use tourism for education, such as trips arranged by university study abroad programs. I contend that both forms of alternative travel represent a reactive approach to mitigating the impacts of mass tourism. The potential of educational travel is not realized as it provides no framework or guidelines as to how students can apply the information and knowledge they have acquired on their trip. I will define a new type of tourism, advocacy travel, which seeks to address the shortfalls of ecotourism and educational travel. Advocacy travel is tourism as a strategy used by activists to educate, promote ideological awareness and motivate participants to work for social change. Global Exchange, a non-profit organization, has been using organized tours as one component of their activist strategy since 1989. Tours to destinations that are politically charged are used as a tactic to create a more politically aware and active citizen from an average person living in the United States. The ultimate goal of the tours is to promote change in the participant that will translate into an increased level of activism around the international issue about which Global Exchange is attempting change. This study is specifically aimed at determining whether tourism utilized in this manner can have a successful outcome for the organization employing it. I developed and distributed a survey questionnaire to Reality Tour participants from both the Cuba and Chiapas programs. Results reveal that the trips do promote an increased awareness of general news and world events and, to a lesser degree, serve to make the participant more politically active overall. However, this result is not equally applied to all participants. Those who indicate a previous awareness of the specific situation of their destination or a more general political knowledge are more likely to report that the Reality Tour inspired them to change. Also, I found that the Reality Tour participant differs greatly from the average US citizen in terms of education level, income, area of residence and occupation."

However, resilience factors in the social environment- including positive social relationships, community connection, and strong cultural traditions and values- may promote and protect health and wellness despite exposure to environmental risks. In early childhood, one critical measure of cognitive health is executive functioning (EF), a cornerstone of development that predicts academic achievement, positive relationships, mental health, and lower instance of substance use and risky behaviors into adulthood. The goals of this dissertation are to (1) explore possible disparities in preschoolers’ exposure to various environmental risks, (2) assess the impact of such environmental risks on EF, and (3) examine how resilience factors may serve as promotive or protective for EF development in the face of environmental risk. Study I defined environmental risk as toxic exposure to flame retardant chemicals, and examined the influence of this exposure and of community resilience-promoting factors on EF in preschool children from underserved backgrounds. Results showed that while racial/ethnic disparities in toxic flame retardant exposure did not emerge, socioeconomic disparities did. Though underpowered, results suggest community resilience may serve as protective for EF in the presence of toxic exposure; in particular, for children from White/Caucasian backgrounds, but future research is needed to clarify this association. Study II defined environmental risk in terms of adverse neighborhood or community conditions, and examined the influence of neighborhood risk and of cultural resilience-promoting factors on EF for preschool children from American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) backgrounds. Despite relatively low socioeconomic status, AI/AN families perceived the risk in their neighborhoods or communities as relatively low in relation to the risk measures used in the study. Neighborhood risk did not predict EF for this sample. Cultural and language socialization (in particular, playing AI/AN games, participating in ceremonies, and making sure the child heard and learned their tribal language) was related to higher EF for AI/AN children. These studies align with existing literature to underscore persistent disparities in environmental risk; but this dissertation adds to the literature by highlighting significant gaps in conceptualization and measurement of risk for children from underserved racial/ethnic backgrounds; especially AI/AN families. Findings from this dissertation also affirm that cultural and community resilience factors have the potential to strengthen child cognition; although children from underserved backgrounds may not experience equal access to the protective features of community resilience in the context of toxic exposure in the built environment. This dissertation will impact policy, practice, future research, and resilience theory development to boost child health and wellness for our most vulnerable families."

Little is known about the true magnitude of the serious threat of violence mortality in AI/AN communities across the United States or differences between separate manners of interpersonal violent death, including homicide, undetermined intent (UD), and legal intervention (LI). Significant gaps in data access, quality, and reliability limit the understanding of contextual and historical factors unique to Indian Country and citizens of Tribal nations, a landscape which research has demonstrated is a key factor in coping and healing from historical and modern violence for AI/AN communities. Guided by a theoretical framework and a historical lens, this dissertation is comprised of two aims to characterize the magnitude of interpersonal violent deaths across the U.S. using multiple levels of place and data from the National Violent Deaths Reporting System (NVDRS). Our first aim examines mortality rates of NVDRS homicide, undetermined intent (UD), and legal intervention (LI) among the AI/AN and compares them to non-Hispanic whites (NHW) in three separate places: 1) national; 2) state; and 3) region. Data were linked to provide a meaningful distinction between deaths that occurred on reservation (or other Tribal) lands (RL) and all other non-Tribal lands (NTL). Violent deaths among the small and only recently disaggregated AI/AN population are further marginalized due to restrictions that precluded rate calculations at the state and regional level, including all AI/AN LIs. In all but one state and all regions where AI/AN violent deaths met reporting standards, rates were higher than NHWs in the same state or region across all manners of death. Multivariable linear regression models showed there was a statistically significant relationship between rates of violent death, race/ethnicity, and place for homicide and UD. The second aim of this dissertation assessed the social, individual, incident, and system-level characteristics of AI/AN homicide, UD, and LI across all available years of NVDRS data (2005-2020) and compared them by place (RL/NTL) to NHWs. Approximately 48% of all AI/AN deaths occurred in places on or near RL, despite estimates from Tribal-serving organizations that only 30%-40% of all AI/AN live on RL. AI/AN victims of homicide, UD, and LI were mostly males, younger, and less educated than NHWs. The predominant weapon type used in all AI/AN violent homicide and LI deaths was a firearm (47.6% and 94.6% respectively) with higher frequencies reported on NTL for homicide (57.6%) and NTL for LI (95.5%). The main weapon type for AI/AN UD was “unknown” (29.4%) compared to poisoning for NHWs (71.5%). Chi square tests of independence were performed to determine associations between autopsy, toxicology, and law enforcement narrative completion by race/ethnicity. AI/AN were slightly more likely to have an autopsy according to NVDRS data, while the odds of a toxicology were lower. The widest disparity was observed for presence of law enforcement narrative, where AI/AN were substantially less likely to have a law enforcement narrative reported for any manner of death, compared to NHWs. Our findings of higher rates of violent death from homicide, UD, and LI across Indian Country compared to NHWs suggest there are significant public health improvements to be made to reach AI/AN communities. Lower age and educational achievement associated with AI/AN decedents indicate socioeconomic factors play a key role in the risk of violent death for AI/AN and existing resources may not sufficiently provide barriers to violence. The glaring issue of restricted access to violence data is an ongoing threat to data sovereignty for Tribal nations and will continue to impede intervention efforts, costing lives and stealing the futures of future generations of AI/ANs. Even with the limitations of our results through policy suppression, this work contributes to our most comprehensive view of violent deaths among AI/AN communities to date and acknowledges that these findings remain an undercount."

This thesis describes the agricultural practices of a group of Mopan farmers and examines farm-site diversification and its relationship to ecological knowledge, out-migration, agricultural markets, and indigenous political systems. I also examine how modernization, religious conversions, and the Mopan's introduction into a capitalist economy have led to a decline in cultural practices and the augmentation of non-traditional behaviors among the younger generations. Data were obtained during my fieldwork in the Cayo and Toledo Districts of southern Belize from June-November, 2002. I conducted informal interviews with farmers and NGOs, engaged in participant observation techniques, documented 17 diversified Mayan farms, and formulated a self-administered questionnaire that was given to 38 students in the San Jose Village School. Additional data was acquired through voluntary work in farmers' fields and from available anthropological and agricultural literature. The results of this study indicate that Mopan farmers have diversified their farming systems by adopting new crop varieties, developing more sustainable agricultural techniques, increasing the production of cash crops, and adjusting their traditional labor systems. These findings are significant because they demonstrate ways in which farming communities throughout the tropics can improve their environments and economies amidst the influences of modernization, unsustainable development, and discriminatory government policies."

I call this form of human the parahuman. The parahuman is thoroughly explored and defined using two postcolonial texts, the film His House directed by Remi Weekes and the novel I, Tituba Black Witch of Salem by Maryse Condé. Furthermore, as I explore the transformation of the nonhuman, I also observe how conquistador humanism when challenged, dismantles the Other and exposes white barbarism. Lastly, I argue that the parahuman reframes borders of identity between the colonized and colonizer which infringe upon another creating a system that relies on the deaths of the colonized. The parahuman explores Black fungibility for the sake of futurity in a postcolonial world."

Utilizing multiple methods of storytelling (narrative, poetry, illustration), Rosales Fertig records how they wrestle with (re)membering the story of their being in personal and intergenerational contexts outside of hegemonic dominant narratives. They seek to answer the questions: how does someone (re)member their story when parts of it have been lost? How does one grieve the missing pieces? How does a queer and trans multiracial person call theirself home in a responsible and non-appropriative way? In a way that feels gentle, feels like returning?"

The-Tlingit Indians substituted trade items for indigenous materials and integrated the resulting blanket into their society as a ceremonial robe. The purpose of this study was twofold. One purpose was to examine historic (pre-1930) and contemporary (post-1930) Button Blankets for form, materials used, and methods of construction. Comparisions were made as to similarities and differences between the two periods. It was concluded that the Tlingit Button Blanket as a whole has maintained its traditional character over time, even though the materials and methods used for construction have changed. The second purpose of this study was to determine if similarities exist between contemporary usage of the Button Blanket and its historic uses. It was found that the,Tlingit Button Blanket is still utilized in its original context, basically associated with socio-religious rites, but usage has diversified and become more secularized."

However, this argument has not adequately addressed the issue of how deep time theories would incorporate the material world. My thesis expands Dimock's theories of deep time in American historical narratives by including how these theories interface with natural structures and how those interactions might in turn shape social texts. In my work, I explore the way deep objects recode a set of historical events from American history: the textual representations of a group of scalphunters known as the Glanton Gang. I first look to Dimock's theories to tease out what a deep time reading would look like including deep objects. I then juxtapose Frederick Jackson Turner's definition of manifest destiny with two varying accounts of the Glanton Gang's travels: one historical memoir from Samuel Chamberlain and one fictional account from Cormac McCarthy. By tracing the interactions between deep objects and American historical narratives, I explore ways social texts are inevitably shaped by natural as well as anthropocentric objects and structures. I argue that by replacing stable histories with timelines of relationality, deep objects de-naturalize the expansion of America’s national border. In conclusion, this project, by closely examining the material world’s influence upon geologic history in American Literature, sheds light on the ways American empire has tried to naturalize its domination for centuries."

Recent population declines in Pacific Northwest streams have triggered new research to understand the life history and ecological significance of this species. These new studies are significant, yet incomplete as they lack the historical context in which to place the data. The Yurok and Karuk Tribes along the Klamath River in Northern California have long had a relationship with Pacific lamprey, utilizing it for both its subsistence and cultural value. Native knowledge of this species is integrated in a complex understanding of natural systems. However, only in the last few decades have the natural resource management skills of indigenous people been recognized by the dominant culture. Hundreds of years of suppression and exploitation limited the abilities of tribes to utilize their traditional management practices. During 2004 and 2005, I lived in the local communities of the Yurok and Karuk tribes while working with their tribal fisheries programs. Utilizing ethnographic methods of participant observation, focus groups, informal interviews, and semi-directed interviews, I gathered traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of Pacific lamprey from more than 80 Yurok and Karuk tribal community members in the Lower Klamath River Basin. While I discourage single species approaches to resource management, in my research I utilized this method to explore and learn from the holistic foundation of Karuk and Yurok TEK. Pacific lamprey became the lens through which I could view and understand lamprey more completely, as well as the ecological and cultural interconnections of the Klamath River system as a whole. In this thesis, I have included much of the TEK shared with me by local eelers and tribal community members about the life history, biology, and ecological significance of Pacific lamprey. I also summarize some of the key points made by participants regarding the cultural significance of Pacific lamprey, including the social, spiritual, and health implications of a declining lamprey population. Additionally, I include knowledge shared with me regarding traditional fisheries management and the role of ceremonies in resource management. Historically, millions of lamprey were seen throughout the Lower Klamath River Basin. Harvests began in late November at the mouth of the river and continued into August as the fish made their way up into the Scott Valley. Tribal community members emphasized the significant role lamprey have in the balance and health of the Klamath River system, both as prey and essential contributors of marine-derived nutrients. According to Karuk and Yurok tribal eelers, lamprey populations began declining in the Klamath River Basin more than forty years ago. It was not uncommon for the eelers of the village to harvest over 1000 lamprey at a time, enough to take care of the entire community. Today, they are lucky to harvest 15 lamprey. Population decline factors have been attributed to the combined influences of logging practices, wetland delineation, Iron Gate Dam, fire suppression, contamination, and predation. I utilize the main TEK contributions from this research to discuss aligning TEK and Western scientific knowledge. I also include recommendations for both Karuk and Yurok tribal fisheries programs and Western fisheries managers in the Klamath Basin on working with TEK and supporting local tribal fisheries management."

With this increase in racial diversity within the greater U.S. population as a whole, the need for accessible and culturally relevant resources in higher education has become more prominent than ever. While the overall population has increased significantly, Pacific Islander students continue to face challenges of access, retention, and lack of culturally relevant resources and support within higher education institutions. Currently, only 18% of Pacific Islander adults possess bachelor's degrees and only 38% of college- aged youth were enrolled in college in 2011 (EPIC & AAAJ, 2014). Statistics like these are often hidden as institutional data on Pacific Islander students are often aggregated with Asian American data within a pan-ethnic Asian Pacific Islander (API) identity, masking the distinct histories, identities, and challenges of many students within higher education. At predominantly White institutions on the continental United States, this identity label and its inconsistent use within data collection and subsequent resource allocation marginalize Pacific Islander students not just within predominantly White communities, but from Asian Americans as well, who make up the majority of the API identity. While forms of research and higher education support for API continues to rise, support for Pacific Islander students, staff, and faculty, specifically are not as evident. Through narrative inquiry, this study examines the experiences of Pacific Islander students through the framework of counter-storytelling in Critical Race Theory at a large predominantly White university in the Pacific Northwest. The research questions that framed this study were as follows: (1) What is the historical significance and influence of identity politics on Pacific Islander students in higher education? (2) How has familial, community, and institutional context influenced students' understanding of their Pacific Islander identities leading into their transition into college? (3) How do these identities impact and show up in their college experience? (4) How can the institution better support Pacific Islander student success and identity development during their college career? This study contributes to existing literature that center the experiences of Pacific Islander students in higher education and their narratives analyzing the way the institution interacts with that aspect of their identity. The researcher concludes with implications from findings and recommendations for higher education professionals to utilize on their campuses."

Despite its promises of inclusion and interculturality, this approach continues to rely on highly trained specialists, leaving little space for local practices that create and maintain well-being. Research has found that women are central figures in the medically pluralistic health systems that characterize the Andes. This ethnographic study explores the heterogeneity of mothers' food and health care practices in a rural village in the province of Carchi. Participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and free listing provide evidence of a wide variety of practices involving foods and home remedies that serve to maintain health. These are often reflective of a nostalgia for an imagined healthier past, which comes forth strongly during the postpartum period and young child feeding. Mothers often treat the most common child illnesses at home with a variety of remedies, many of which are also consumed as foods. In addition to home care, mothers navigate and engage with a pluralistic health system by visiting folk healers and consulting medical doctors when needed. Their practices are inherently shaped by their limited access to resources, and they reflect hybrid knowledges that are responsive to dynamic ""healthscapes"". These findings suggest that mothers act as primary care givers by enacting dynamic knowledges through their practices, and I argue that fostering the diversity and interculturality of sumak kawsay may require greater inclusion of mothers' home practices in national development agendas."

The worker, raised and educated in the United States, was separated from his ancestral village until his thirties. The worker, with a Masters degree in education from Oregon State University, returned to live in his village in Canada in 1993, dedicating his life to assisting with preserving and revitalising his people's language and culture. As such, the socio-psychological parameters of his life from birth until the present provide vital insights into the lives, the problems and the angst typically faced by First Nations language workers. The purpose of this study is twofold. 1. Through the traditional genre of Aboriginal autobiography, the dissertation provides crucial insights and primary-source data regarding First Nations realities. The intent is to encourage further studies of the plight of the few existing First Nations language workers, many of whom leave their work due to becoming overwhelmed and discouraged. 2. The author advocates for the founding of an international Aboriginal Peace Corps, a proposed coalition of First Nations communities, national governments and the private sector. The goal of the Aboriginal Peace Corps would be to put skilled workers into indigenous communities to work alongside community members. In view of the high rate of deaths among elders, the last language speakers in most communities, immediate assistance is urgently needed. While time remains, only through an Aboriginal Peace Corps can communities obtain sufficient expertise in accelerated language learning and in resource technologies to revitalise and perpetuate their languages."

Being of mixed African and Native American heritage, I understand the significant role slavery and its aftermath has had on the identity and family connection of people of mixed African and Native Heritage. The disruption of the family and the destruction of identity are part of the legacy left by the institution of chattel slavery. Persons of mixed Native, African and European heritage are products of intertwined heritages that mark the manifestation of the slavery system and the impact the institution has had on how they choose to identify or are forced to identify. Because of the ingrained racialized practices of the United States, identity for persons of color is decided and based on phenotype characteristics of the individual. For a person of mixed heritage identity, description can be further hindered when their identity is measured and challenged by ethnic and racial standards of the larger White society. These standards and trends work their way into the lives and cultures of the smaller groups to the point that their identities no longer belong to them. As a way to maintain a small degree of control over their families and identities, families passed down oral renderings to each generation. Using a collection of oral histories and personal narrative, this study works to preserve information regarding familial and kinship ties between persons of Native and African American heritage. It examines how slavery, by Native Americans against African Americans, affects kinship ties, identity, and its role in the facilitation or hindrance of the transmission of familial and kinship knowledge of peoples of mixed Native and African American heritage."

Part of this change is directly related to the representation of their cultures in a museum setting and the inception of cultural resource laws that govern them. This research looks at four museums, two in the United States and two in the United Kingdom, and compares their representation of Native Americans. Unlike museums in the United States, museums in the United Kingdom do not have to comply with laws that protect source communities. A source community is defined as the original group that an object found in a museum setting originates. Laws like the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990) have shaped the relationship between museums and Native Americans in the United States. It has fostered a deeper understanding of Native American worldviews in American museum displays. This research demonstrates how American museums have changed the way they plan for and create displays about Native Americans because of cultural resource laws. This research reveals three movements in the United States that have occurred, due in part to cultural resource laws. First, the dichotomy between museums’ relationship to their visitors in comparison to their responsibilities to source communities and how this has shifted; second, funding and the power struggle it has created in museums. Third, the issue of repatriation of objects, both nationally and internationally, due to the variety of opinions that surround this topic; and how this demonstrates a better working relationship with Native Americans in the United States, and is cause for great strife for the United Kingdom and other countries. These three illuminate the uneven relationship between museums and Native Americans and how cultural resource laws in the United States have begun to alter this relationship. NAGPRA has helped to reestablish Native Americans’ legal authority over their culture in the United States."

More specifically, this project explores how diversity-related workload expectations impact faculty of color who work in predominantly white community colleges. Known by various descriptors, the term used in this research project to capture additional diversity-related workload requests experienced by faculty of color is “cultural taxation.” The “technique” or method used in this study to document the experiences of faculty of color in predominantly white community colleges was narrative testimonios. The use of narratives was important because this project looked at the degree to which diversity-related work role expectations and experiences personally and professionally impact faculty of color in predominantly white institutions. The following were used as the guiding questions in capturing, through culturally appropriate and respectful human interaction, the lived personal and professional experiences of faculty of color: • Have you had any experiences with “cultural taxation?” • Describe from both personal and professional perspectives, your experiences working in predominantly white institutions? • What techniques have you tried in order to achieve a sense of balance in your personal and professional lives? Five primary themes emerged from the analysis of the data collected from the narrative testimonios. The five primary themes are all connected to the concept of “cultural taxation.” Whereas scholars previously established clear and concise parameters to identify and define “cultural taxation,” the complex series of themes that emerged from this research project provide a rich “fleshing out” of the concept. The five primary themes are as follows: 1) Cultural Taxation and Racist Bigotry, 2) Cultural Taxation and Convenience, 3) Cultural Taxation and Conscious Choice, 4) Cultural Taxation and Ignorance, and 5) Cultural Taxation and Pragmatism. The findings encourage community college leaders to engage in critical dialogue about structural changes that need to occur to ensure a work environment where all employees can engage in collaboration and partnership without a small number of employees becoming overworked in the area of diversity-related initiatives."

As a case study, research took place in the Klamath-Siskiyou region of rural Northern California, in Humboldt and Siskiyou counties. The research area is within the ancestral territory of the Karuk Tribe and the United States Forest Service manages the majority of the land. The location is characterized by its dependency on forest resources, high levels of biodiversity, current wildfire problem, and community interest in fuels reduction activities. Forest restoration includes restoration of the historic fire regime, which is difficult given current ecological and cultural constraints. Methods of forest restoration include mechanical treatment, prescribed fire and natural fire use. Restoration of historic fire regimes on private land can facilitate the restoration of adjacent federal lands and encourage the development of wildland fire use. In order to represent the complexity of cultural and ecological interactions within the research area, the analytical frameworks of political ecology and symbolic anthropology were utilized. Community interests included creating sustainable livelihoods, developing community capacity, creating and changing policy, and the creation of flexible treatment prescriptions."

This research was conducted in the Yungas region of Bolivia in isolated mountain communities that are part of the established traditional and legal area for coca growing and thus clearly integrated into the world ""commodities"" market via the illicit cocaine economy. Curiously, many farmers continue to grow crops for local markets, their homes, and organic coca for traditional use. Is this part of a greater movement of revolutionary agrarian policy or concern for food sovereignty in local communities? Under this context, I explore how some individual farmers and farming associations have developed a tradition of growing Andean root crops and their lived experience of their involvement in the associations. Through participant observation and ethnographic interviews with members of two Yungueño community associations and with regional technicians, this study explores how associations and individuals negotiate national and international policy, and NGO activity, in order to create specialty niche markets for native crops. This thesis argues that alternative agricultural development that has focused on coca reduction, export-oriented agriculture, and food security has, to a large extent, been a failure. Rather, local initiatives that focus on ecological coca, food sovereignty, and native crops for local markets taken together are meeting some local development goals. This study provides an opportunity for reframing development theory and expanding the literature on food sovereignty. The concept of the La Paz-El Alto food-shed is used as a tool for exploring the potential of reorienting the moral economy around food in re-creating a more sustainable food system. From the perspectives of an Andean root crop association, I explore particular challenges members face in farming in contested lands of commodity coca production. Associations begin by meeting specialty market needs for ritual uses of specialty Andean crops, and may utilize a variety of assistance programs but are determined to maintain a high level of autonomy. Associations are often cautious in searching for assistance because farmers cannot afford to lose time expanding alternative crops that could be better spent in coca production. Failure is common, and few associations achieve goals of significantly increased incomes. Rather semi-subsistence and diversification along with coca growing provide greater autonomy and sovereignty in practical terms when many of the anticipated national reforms are yet to be seen in these particular Yungueño communities. In addition, I briefly explore with farmers the environmental considerations and perspectives to climate, gardening, biodiversity loss, and the concern about the use of chemical applications."

The food system is a vital starting point. What are the principles of reinhabitory food systems? What are the possibilities for a locally adapted food system in the Marys River region of western Oregon? I describe past and present food systems in the region and give recommendations for building a reinhabitory food system. Native people established locally adapted food systems in the Marys River region and maintained them for thousands of years, culminating in the Kalapuyan food system that existed at Euroamerican contact. Euroamericans began to settle in the region in 1845, and immediately began to domesticate the landscape, replacing native ecosystems with cropland and pasture. By 1900, a diversified food system had emerged with several locally adapted characteristics. The industrial food system replaced the diversified food system during World War II, and has dominated since then. Locally adapted elements of food systems were rapidly abandoned. Industrialism emphasized mass production of export crops using fossil fuels, heavy machinery, and agrichemicals. A large variety of cultural, economic, and ecological problems emerged, and the health of natural and human communities was diminished. Reinhabitation is a positive response to the problems of industrial food systems. A locally adapted food system in the Marys River region is possible. There is enough agricultural land to feed the population. A small but growing segment of the local population has established alternative food systems, and initiated the process of building a regional food system. Reviewing the history of the Marys River region helps clarify how to apply principles of reinhabitation in the region."

While advisory groups and collaboratives on federal lands have been studied extensively, much less is known about network governance as it pertains to state lands management. In particular, the role of power dynamics in state-level network governance is an articulated gap in scientific understanding. Through a comparative case study of state-convened advisory groups in New York’s High Peaks Region and Oregon’s Elliott State Forest, I explore the extent to which these network governance efforts distribute power as well as how participants characterize their impacts. I conducted semi-structured interviews and document analysis to collect and analyze qualitative data on four dimensions of power (formal authority, resources, discursive legitimacy, and trust) and five dimensions of democracy (access, public deliberation, adaptability, accountability, and political identities). Results indicate that while power is overwhelmingly held by the state in establishing advisory groups, its distribution is more nuanced through the process phase. Additionally, process participants broadly developed political identities through these efforts. However, the extent to which participants impacted management outcomes and were empowered varied both across and between cases. My findings reflect a lack of equity both in terms of who held and developed power as well as who impacted management decisions and developed empowerment through the studied network governance efforts. To address these inequities, I recommend that those with authority over network governance efforts implement mechanisms for explicit power sharing within them."

In an effort led by the Yurok Tribe of Northern California and various conservation organizations, four dams are being removed on the Klamath River to improve water quality, restore ecosystems, and increase populations of salmon species that are culturally significant to multiple Tribes in the basin. The long-term goal is to create a structured decision model that bridges social and ecological data to assess costs and benefits of future environmental decision-making related to water. This thesis builds a cultural model for resource management for farmers and ranchers in the Klamath Basin. It examines data collected from free-listing and semi-structured interviews to identify important management priorities related to water, land use, and communities. These priorities include fair representation, data informed decisions, multi-purpose management, and localized management. These objectives are seen as a way to improve resource management as it relates to agriculture. Improving resource management in the Klamath Basin is important to farmers and ranchers because of their connection to the landscape and the continuity of their livelihoods. Farmers and ranchers also see these objectives as a way to strengthen relationships with other community groups, specifically local Tribes, through better communication and collaboration. "

Deschutes and Klamath Counties, Oregon, have three proposed conservation tenures: a community forest, a state forest, and a tribal forest. The community forest would be the first of its kind in the state, a large, land trust-owned forest at the edge of a rapidly-growing city. The state forest, geographically more isolated, would be the first state-owned forest in Oregon in 60 years. The tribal forest, also geographically isolated, would return former reservation land to the Klamath Tribes, which were terminated in 1954. All three forest ownership opportunities were created through opportunistic risk-taking, the leverage of political and human capitals, social networks, strong leadership, and land availability as a result of industrial forest restructuring. This case study research used multiple methods, including interviews and document analysis, to explore the forests' unique histories, and draws lessons about changing community capacities, forest management, and forest governance and under these emerging tenures."

The scale of this submerged land mass further adds to the challenge of how to search for archaeological evidence of the human migration. This thesis proposes an approach to submerged site discovery in Beringia intended to reduce the total area that needs to be considered in a predictive model by focusing on a key resource, salmon. The cultural importance of salmon to Indigenous peoples across the North Pacific is broadly acknowledged, and increasingly, that importance is being incorporated into hypotheses regarding the peopling of the Americas. The concept of salmon as a “magnet” resource is used here as a way to prioritize submerged areas for further analysis toward a predictive site discovery model. This paper incorporates studies of modern salmon DNA, ethnography, archaeology, and geo-spatial analyses into the preliminary phases of a predictive model. The framework of the Danish Model for submerged site discovery is adapted here for Beringia. The analyses discussed here are aimed at identifying areas within the larger region that would be suitable for further phase III and IV investigation."

Together, these two characteristics are the foundation of human subsistence patterns. In many remote Alaskan villages, these features manifest through social networks of food sharing in which a small number of households harvest the bulk of the resources consumed by the local community. For subsistence researchers in Alaska, the productivity of these households is understood to be crucial to the food security of populations that depend on subsistence resources of the bulk of their nutrition. While the diversity of resources that these communities use is acknowledged, it has not been analytically investigated. This thesis applies the quantitative methods of social network analysis and multivariate statistics to a dataset containing information on food sharing connections, resource harvest levels and their species composition, and household demographic characteristics in 8 Alaskan villages on the Middle Kuskokwim River. The goal of this analysis is to better understand the diversity of species that are used in these villages and to test whether a household’s position within a food sharing network is related to the diversity of their harvest."

While drinking water is widely available in much of the U.S., there are still vulnerable communities that lack access, which signifies the presence of inequity in drinking water access distributions. In response, this research sought to explore solutions and develop reconnaissance-level plans to address inequities in drinking water access in the U.S. By using a transdisciplinary lens of inquiry to examine drinking water access for the residents of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, the author described the water access landscape, generated and evaluated potential technical solutions, proposed potential policy pathways to facilitate the implementation of the technical solutions, and finally discussed the feasibility of the long-term assurance of drinking water access for the residents based on societal values and ethics. The results included a collection of options for planning. The research revealed that drinking water access was challenged through political factors that influenced water infrastructure failures. In order to ensure drinking water access, stakeholders must incorporate ethics and value-based policies into technical and planning actions. While drinking water access can be ensured in the short-term through the technical and political solutions and plans identified in this research, the long-term sustainability of the assurance of drinking water access is uncertain due to a lack of institutionalized ethics and values. While some findings of this research can be applied to other vulnerable communities in the U.S., the author urges caution because each community is different and warrants individual analysis before the implementation of any technical or political actions."

The purpose of this research was to discover what barriers smallholder farmers face in developing more sustainable agroecosystems and to then apply those barriers as possible indicators in a three tiered model of sustainability that included social, environmental, and economic components. This research built on the theory and praxis of political ecology to gather information concerning the local knowledge held by smallholder farmers in the region. The two-fold design of this research called for the collection of relevant background information assessing secondary agricultural and geographical data pertaining to the Ten Rivers region and ethnographic data gathered through conducting semi-structured interviews with local smallholder farmers who were organically certified or used other sustainable methods of agricultural production. Quantitative and qualitative information was considered in order to provide a more complete analysis of how smallholder farmers in the region use local knowledge to manage individual farming operations, in the context of a global market, and to address the barriers that inhibit them from becoming more sustainable. Barriers to sustainability faced by smallholder farmers were applied as possible indicators to a three tiered model designed for assessing agricultural sustainability. Since defining barriers to sustainability is determined by local perceptions of risk, and often varies from region to region, the model addressed sustainability in the form of questions to be considered within the interrelated context of social, economic, and environmental issues. The conclusion of the study was that it is better to address the problems of sustainability from a farmer-centered, regional basis, rather than developing an externally imposed universal measure of sustainability where too much information can be lost or misinterpreted."

Adam Kelly has called this attitude, when combined with the appropriation of certain metafictional and postmodern techniques, the “New Sincerity”; associated authors coalesce around a common response to the solipsism of postmodernity as literary mode and cultural episteme. New Sincerity fiction attempts to restore nonironic engagement with spiritual and ethical concerns through affective, polyphonic, and performative avenues. But the New Sincerity fails in its rehabilitation and redirection of contemporary aesthetics and has thus invited criticism regarding its inability to address the urgency of minoritarian identities. We ought to refigure New Sincerity, reaffirming its efforts towards reparative and non-subjective discourse without re-inscribing the white and male. To this end, a thorough reading of Leslie Marmon Silko’s work illuminates a minoritarian critique of postmodern that predates other New Sincerity authors and encourages an expansion of the definitions and canons of the post-postmodern and New Sincerity.  "

The researcher, also a Northern Cheyenne tribal member used testimonio based on its roots in resistance literature and as a means of perpetuating cultural survival in the face of contemporary cultural and racial genocide. The Northern Cheyenne use oral history and storytelling to perpetuate and influence cultural survival. The primary significance of the stories was based on what other Northern Cheyenne women hear in the voices in the story that impact their own educational journey, achievement and success. Secondary impact will be what the teller's family and community hear in the stories and then what those outside the reservation community hear. The theoretical foundation of the research focused on the literature of the following areas: colonization and genocide; oral history and storytelling; collective voice, the plural self, voice and empowerment and roles in healing historical trauma; American Indian education and Indian women's experiences with education. The research includes the testimonios of six Northern Cheyenne women gathered on or near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. The findings suggest that the following story threads were significant to Northern Cheyenne women in their educational journeys and experiences: spirituality; family especially grandparents and parents; cultural traditions- especially language and ceremonies; cultural values of honesty, integrity, generosity, hard work; value for land, cultural pride and identity even when it's fragmented or a struggle to maintain; Cheyenne lifeways meals, cooking, gathering, hunting, singing, spending time with family, and social events; the opportunity of access to higher education; living between two worlds; remembering our past history and using it as a guide for now and the future; and finally thinking of future generations. The findings suggest the tools needed for Northern Cheyenne women to succeed academically and educationally, already inherently exist in Northern Cheyenne social and cultural structures. Continuing to deconstruct the barriers and tenets of oppression will fully allow a rebirth of these cultural concepts and practices strengthening Northern Cheyenne society and education."

Latour’s call for the Earthbound is to re-trace networks of society, institutions, and meaning and to challenge, as enemy, those that would continue to behave as if we lived on more than one Earth or would fall prey to the hubris in thinking our solutions were merely technological. Modernist separations of Science and Religion are shown rooted in perceptions and narratives of separateness over the reality of their hybridity and imbrication. Realizing this imbrication, science and religion need not be at odds. Modes of contemplative practices of mindfulness, meditation, and aikido mirror these calls for Latour’s Earthbounded reformation and reorientate the apparent dualities of human origins. Contemplative pedagogies also trace similar modalities of transdisciplinarity in academia and focus on corroborative practice over dogmatic narrative. This is traced through the work by way of a snail’s view, in homage to marginalia, the marginalized, and the chthonic beings of the overlooked world; this view situates an Earthboundedness, sensitivity to kin and encounter, and a praxis for moving forth-with, accomplishing reconciliation and reciprocity. In this way, we may better perceive the vicissitudes of and connect with the Anthropocene, face Gaia, and make kin of enemies, political and ecological."

As environmental problems mount, accounts of historic ecological conditions and the factors of change become increasingly useful. This study considers competing schools of interpretation about human impacts on ecological landscapes and develops a case study of one thirty-six square mile township in Oregon’s Waldo Hills. Built on evidence from 1851 surveyor notes, maps, journals, aerial photos, interviews, and contemporary environmental and ecological data, this study demonstrates a transformation from ecologically diverse ecosystems under the management of native peoples to ecologically depressed monoculture landscapes under industrialized agriculture. This thesis argues that the fundamental beliefs of human societies (i.e., worldviews) become expressed in the landscape. The nature-as-community view of the Kalapuya Indians resulted in a complex, curvilinear mosaic of prairie, savanna, and woodland. The individualized and rationalized view of the Euroamericans resulted in a simplified landscape of squared-off fields, channelized streams, and roads aligned to the survey grid. Thomas Jefferson’s rectangular survey, built on the ‘virtuous square’, is examined as a symbolic and tangible instrument of rapid expansion and exploitation across the American West. Understanding that worldviews become expressed in physical conditions may benefit those working to create sustainable futures; i.e., long-term and widespread ecological improvements will likely succeed only if society at large shares a fundamental belief in the value of healthy ecosystems."

With the conflict-filled history of AIAN education, AIAN education disparities, and the dearth of AIAN college success research in mind the aims of this study are to 1. identify how family, community, and Tribe influence student success for AIAN students, and 2. begin a dialogue around student experiences and success to promote a sense community within the AIAN population at Oregon State University (OSU). Together these aims identify the needs of the AIAN population at OSU and begin the process of addressing those needs to promote student success. AIAN students enrolled at OSU, 18 years of age or older were invited to participate in a focus group around their higher education experiences. Participants were asked to share on the topics of family, community and Tribe and its influence on their higher education experience. Through four focus groups comprised of self-identifying AIAN students (N=16), this qualitative study found family as support and barrier, Tribe as support and barrier, Native identity, culture clash, OSU resources, and OSU-Tribal connections to be predominant themes relating to student success. Financial support, Tribal unfairness, paradoxical cultural pressure, AIAN advising, and blood quantum were found to be supporting themes. Family and Tribe were found to provide supports, but also act as barriers to AIAN student success while community was found to be neither a support nor a barrier. Students described finding family-like supports away from their family by creating a sense of family through their friends while at college. Students identified other individuals outside of their family and Tribe that were valuable supports. Students identified conflict in the historical context of the education system and Native identity that may play a role in AIAN student success. Students rejected the roots of the higher education system for several reasons, but especially because its original purpose was to provide White men the credentials to run the government, which is the same government that oppressed our ancestors and utilized the education system as a tool for deculturation and assimilation. Students described their primary motivation to succeed in college as being able to return to their Tribe and give back to their Tribal community, despite this devaluation of higher education. Participants provided suggestions for OSU and the 9 Tribes of Oregon to consider in providing better supports to AIAN students. The primary suggestion was to improve communication and collaboration between OSU and the local Tribes of Oregon. Suggestions included hiring an AIAN academic advisor, promoting culturally knowledgeable services at Counseling and Psychological Services, and several suggestions for AIAN community events. The participant-identified issues of Native identity, culture clash, blood quantum, and paradoxical cultural pressures; how these issues relate to success in higher education for these students, is discussed. The results of this study add to the sparse literature on AIAN college success, reinforcing the importance of family and Tribe and underlining the complexity of AIAN issues in higher education. Further research should look into Participatory Action Research to promote change through research. The active dissemination of these results to OSU, the Tribes of Oregon, and identified supports is absolutely essential in promoting higher education success for American Indian/Alaska Native students at Oregon State University."

It sought to understand the essence of tribal police chiefs’ experiences in working within the U.S. legal system and the extent of conflict that has been created for them. It further sought to examine how tribal police chiefs navigate and provide effective leadership as they work to maintain tribal culture, traditions, and sovereignty within their departments. This research is of significance because there has been a lack of research directed toward developing tribal police leadership programs that assist police chiefs in navigating through a conflicting and opposing U.S. legal system. Although there have been limited studies on tribal law enforcement, those studies have primarily focused on quantitative data related to crime statistics in Indian Country. This research study gives tribal law enforcement education and training practitioners, and advocacy group’s direction in creating tribal leadership trainings that address gaps that exist in Native American police training programs. The following two questions were used to guide the research: (1) How are U.S. legal system challenges affecting tribal culture, traditions, and sovereignty, and how do tribal police chiefs address them? (2) How do tribal police chiefs maintain and/or support tribal traditions and culture within the tribal police department despite working within contradictory, opposing, or restrictive U.S. laws and regulations? This research design followed a multi-case study methodology focusing on seven Native American police chiefs who work in departments located in Indian Country across the United States. A multi-case study approach provided an opportunity to compare and contrast the challenges that exist for tribal police chiefs who must work under the mandated U.S. legal system. This research study used five primary data collection methods: (a) in-depth, open-ended interviews; (b) journaling; (c) peer review; (d) member checking; and (e) the review of related documents and archival records. The collection of data resulted in the emergence of following four dominant themes: 1. The U.S. legal system has had a significant influence on the operations of today's tribal police departments and their adherence to tribal culture, tradition, and sovereignty. 2. Tribal police chiefs and their departments have unequal police power and authority in Indian Country. 3. Jurisdictional restrictions created by the U.S. legal system have created complex, confusing, and challenging conflicts for tribal police chiefs. 4. The U.S. legal system has created an environment of bias and restrictive policing practices for tribal police chiefs and their departments. This study revealed that Native American police chiefs are highly dedicated professionals working under an unequal set of legal constraints and restrictive police powers. To allow them to fully administer the leadership duties and responsibilities expected of them by their tribes and peers, tribal police chiefs need access to training and support systems that will assist them in understanding how to navigate through complex challenges surrounding legal issues and tribal policing power and legal authority. This research provides clarity for educators, trainers, and tribal law enforcement advocates who are seeking to understand and develop tribal leadership training programs for tribal police chiefs. This research provides insights into the multitude of existing legal system problems that currently are not being addressed through tribal leadership training and education. Hopefully this research will add to the body of knowledge on tribal police leadership and encourage academic and training professionals to actively pursue training initiatives that will support tribal police chiefs as they continue to lead within their tribal police departments."

A mixture of Native American and Euro-American socio-cultural management has developed from adaptations to climate, topography, ecological processes, and land use practices. This research incorporates Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to partially examine the role of tribal fire uses and ethnobotany. Research methods use an interdisciplinary approach to characterize fuels and fire management issues in culturally significant riparian and terrestrial habitats. Tribal fuels and fire management practices were investigated. Understanding past tribal fire management systems is needed to place contemporary Native American fuels and fire management issues in to context for government agencies and private interest that have altered tribal opportunities to continue fire uses. This study examined fire effects on sandbar willow (Salix exigua) in valley riparian zones along the lower mid-Klamath River. Prescribed fire was used to induce sprouting of sandbar willow and reduce insect populations to improve basket material quantity and quality. Results indicate that flooding had greater affects on the structure, composition, and abundance of vegetation and fuels than prescribed fire. A second experiment to compare the effect of propane burning and pruning sandbar willow indicated that propane burning was less effective than pruning to improve stem morphology for basket weaving. Consultation with tribal basket weavers and research of the proportion of useable willow shoots, amount of insect damage and the relationship of stem diameter and length revealed these attributes were important criteria for determining usability for weaving. This research also included other basketry plants. TEK is used to better understand fire effects on culturally significant resources and the consequences of fire suppression on terrestrial and riparian habitats. The mechanisms of how fire suppression impacts tribes, resources and tribal land uses are presented. Recommendations are presented for additional research to improve collaboration with tribes, tribal organizations and communities based on contemporary tribal values and priorities for fuels and fire management."

Competitive relationships between herbaceous and woody flora in the northern Great Basin are discussed, focusing broadly on the shrubsteppe regions 'of Franklin and Dyrness (1973) but with special reference to the Artemisia/Agropyron association. Impacts of native and domestic grazing animals and of cultural burning are traced from the distant past into recent history. During the Pleistocene Epoch North America supported a wide diversity of large mammals. Toward the end of the Pleistocene, many of these fauna became extinct, perhaps as a result of post-glacial climatic change, perhaps also under the influence of incoming primitive hunting cultures and their broadcast burning practices. Some question exists about the intensity of native grazing in the northern Great Basin during the last few thousand years. Actual levels of bison populations and the duration of their residence in the study area have not been determined. The character of indigenous vegetations, however, indicates that native grazing was relatively light for an extended period primevally. Twenty-four references to native cultural burning at the time of European contact were found in historical journals. Though the antiquity of these customs is uncertain, an analysis of Native American fire myths demonstrates the depth of native cultural perceptions of the relationship between man and fire, and supports the likelihood that fire was used primevally in the northern Great Basin as it was used by aboriginal peoples elsewhere in North America. With the influx of European culture during the 19th century, misapprehensions about fire among whites distorted the influence of native cultural burning. Exotic flora and fauna were introduced, and ecosystems began to change. Large herds of livestock depleted native herbaceous populations. Early irresponsible burning by whites became associated with declining rangeland resources, and efforts toward total fire suppression became incorporated in developing conservation policies. Native woody flora and exotics began to invade open rangeland communities. Climatic flux during the period of European settlement in the northern Great Basin may have exacerbated the impacts of intensified grazing and elimination of burning. Early photographs of rangelands in east-central Oregon were gathered; their dates range from 1880 to the early 1930's. Sites represented in these pictures were re-photographed in 1976. Photo-set comparisons show expansion of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) populations into rangeland ecosystems, demonstrating the consequences of cultural disturbances during the last 150 to 200 years."

A historical framework is provided within which the nature and magnitude of these effects can be assessed. This paper provides a discussion of the effects of federal termination policy on the health of the Coquille tribe. The health of the Coquille tribe is compared to that of other Indians, and to the Oregon All Races group. The effect of efforts by the Indian Health Service to improve the health of Indian people in the United States is appraised. Efforts of the Coquille Tribe to address the long-standing problem of inadequate health care for its tribal members are documented. Particular attention is given to the achievements of the Coquille Tribal Health Department since 1989, when recognition of the Coquille Tribe's sovereign status was restored by Congress. Secondary research employed both archival and library sources. The primary research consisted of compilation of data from unpublished Coquille tribal documents and interviews. The interviews were conducted with staff members of the Coquille Tribal Health Department and with elders of the Coquille tribe old enough to remember the health care systems prior to termination. Additional interviews were conducted with elders from other Oregon tribes and with staff of the Indian Health Service clinic in Salem, Oregon. The major conclusions are that though the federal government passed its termination laws in 1954, for the Coquille ""termination"" was actually a process that began in the 1850s and continued on for over one hundred years. Termination for the Coquille only gained ""official"" recognition by Congress in 1954. The negative health effects upon the Coquille people were due to the actual termination, not the official termination. Since the Coquille tribe gained restoration of its federal recognition it has established a solid base for a health care system for its members. Plans for the growth of this health department and the expansion of the services it offers should, when implemented, provide for the health care needs of the tribe and other Indians in the area."

Sense of place (SOP), the formed relationships between an individual and the environment, has been considered a fundamental aspect of human well-being and can contribute to more holistic understanding of people’s preferences and behaviors regarding natural resource management. In order to better understand SOP associated with the Quinault Indian Reservation (QIR) we measured the strength of this concept across different stakeholder groups. In agreement with previous literature, we found that SOP varies between groups based on amount of visitation to the reservation and participation in resource harvest. Additionally, using a discrete choice experiment we elicited preferences and willingness-to-pay estimates for stream restoration on the QIR. We showed that when making tradeoffs between restoration alternatives, SOP was a stronger factor in decision making than the actual physical environmental outcomes of restoration. We also identified some social benefits from restoration. These results contribute to SOP theory by applying a quantitative assessment to tribal groups and assessing SOP influence on restoration preferences. In its entirety, the research could influence Quinault management’s decision making as we highlighted some important human factors associated with the reservation environment."

They exhibit the craftsmanship and artistic merit that characterize the Plains art style. This study examines decorated saddle blankets from three viewpoints. An historical overview suggests that although the horse and horsegear originated with Spanish occupation of the New World, the Plains decorated saddle blanket was an indigenous innovation. Available literary and pictorial information for Hispanic horsegear indicate that Spanish traditions of decoration did not include saddle blankets of the types found among Plains peoples. Saddle blankets are examples of the material culture of the Plains. In this respect they have been examined in terms of materials, construction, decoration, and use. Verbal and pictorial information, as well as extant examples provided information. Saddle blankets exhibit characteristics of shape and decorative style that are related to region and specific groups. They used both native and introduced materials and techniques. With some exceptions, they appear to have been made by and for women. As works of art, saddle blankets are part of a tradition that stressed the importance of the horse to Plains culture and used horse decoration to provide social messages about the rider to onlookers. This tradition included gender specific art styles, elaborate horse gear as a sign of wealth and generosity, and personal skill as a means of acquiring prestige. Decorated blankets are an example of a functional object achieving artistic value, alone and in combination with other objects."

A border between territories can be seen as a space that is separated; however, it is actually one with the potential to unite populations and environments. A river basin is generally defined by its topography and hydrology. New paradigms in river basin management point towards expanding this definition to include culture, values and placed-based knowledge (Jackson 2011; Jackson et al. 2015). By including these aspects, we can have more informed and comprehensive planning that addresses the needs of river basin residents (Wolf 2008; Jackson 2011). This research explores and addresses how incorporating culture and values is being implemented and included in river basin management plans (Wolf 2008; Cosens 2012; Jackson and Palmer 2012) through a case study of the Sixaola River Basin— an international transboundary river basin located in Central America that is shared between Costa Rica, Panamá and five indigenous communities: the Bríbrí, Naso, Cabecar, Brunca and Ngöbe. This case study exemplifies how these practices are being applied to water resources management at international, national and local levels. Through collaborative participatory research, videography, photography and storytelling, I explore lessons learned in the Sixaola River Basin and take note of how this approach can be used in other international transboundary river basin management plans worldwide (Jackson et al. 2015). Findings in this work include: 1) the importance of integrating culture and values in river basin management, 2) the effectiveness of co-managed research, and 3) the value of increasing communication and information exchange of river basin residents."

Despite their notable size, Native Americans in this six county area are either ineligible for, or inaccessible to, federally sponsored Indian health facilities available to Native peoples elsewhere. Research was conducted over an eight month period to determine the prevalence of Native American mental health problems, rates of service utilization, and cultural appropriateness of available services. For thesis study, inquiries focused on use of traditional medicine and Indian providers as viable alternatives to the established non-Indian mental health system. Under the supervision of the Southwest Oregon Indian Health Project, interviews were held with service providers, clients, and members of local Indian populations. Results show that southwest Oregon Native Americans underutilize county mental health facilities due to real and/or perceived barriers to treatment. Among these are cultural barriers in which non-Indian therapists do not, or are unable to, respond appropriately to tradition-oriented Indian clients. An exception is the alcohol programs which Native Americans use more often. It is clear that participation in these programs is greater due to the higher prevalence of alcohol problems, increased cultural sensitivity among staff, and differing attitudes toward being alcoholic as opposed to ""crazy"". Three Indian-specific alcohol programs within or adjacent to the service area are particularly attractive to Native American clients. Native peoples frequently expressed interests in developing their own programs, accessing traditional medicine people, and having more input within the existing county system. Indian alcohol programs have become a rallying place for Indian self-determination in mental health care because they adhere to Native beliefs and values, and are refuges for traditionally- oriented providers and clients. Unfortunately, their existence is tenuously linked to non-Indian funding sources and regulations -- a situation difficult to improve from either side. Research conclusions indicate that Native American mental health treatment is in a transitional period. A resurgence of interest in the use of traditional medicine has been part of the transition. Improved legislation for Indian health care and religious freedom have contributed to the articulation and organization of Native American concerns. Answers to self-determination in southwest Oregon Native American mental health care will become more evident as Pan- Indian issues are resolved and communities develop better communications and referral networks with local Indian populations. Infringing economic constraints can be alleviated if community treatment facilities use more sensitive, personalized outreach to Native Americans in their areas, and if they allow them greater control in determining traditional treatment alternatives."

The study seeks to understand how farmers define sustainability and how their views on agricultural issues help to define a sense of place and identity in the Marys River region, within the context of the globalized agricultural system. This project builds on past research utilizing the theory and praxis of political ecology, but also incorporates elements of bioregionalism to develop a theoretical model of regional political ecology for an integrated and multidisciplinary approach to answering the research questions. The study asks: 1) How do farmers in the Marys River region define agricultural sustainability? 2) What methods do farmers use to develop more sustainable agroecosystems? 3) What do farmers consider to be the most important issues in developing a more sustainable regional community within the globalized system of agriculture? A critical synthesis of information is developed establishing bioregional political ecology within the conceptual framework of the project. The study then describes the broad social and economic contexts that potentially shape and constrain farmer conceptualizations of sustainability, focusing on the contrast between the development and characteristics of the globalized system of industrial agriculture and more traditional systems-based methods considered to be alternative forms of agricultural production. The study then uses this conceptual framework to integrate an historical account describing the development of agriculture in the Marys River region with contemporary ethnographic information collected through participant observation and semi-structured interviews with farmers to provide a more holistic understanding of contemporary definitions of agricultural sustainability. This approach of integrating the qualitative information gathered from local farmers with historical and contemporary background information on land-use allowed for a better understanding of farmers' perspectives and definitions of sustainability. A principle finding from this research was that farmers throughout the Marys River region, regardless of farming styles and practices, consider sustainability primarily as the ability to continue farming into the extended future. Farmers' definitions of sustainability are inherently tied to the 'space' of the farm and these findings provide a common ground for dialogue among stakeholders with differing worldviews. This study helps to fill gaps in the existing literature on sustainability and agricultural land-use in the region; namely the perception and conceptualization of sustainability by its farmers. This more comprehensive understanding of how farmers relate to sustainability will help farmers, policymakers, and other institutions to better work together in making more informed decisions toward building stronger communities and developing a more sustainable bioregion within the global marketplace

The project included interviewing native elders, characterizing stream habitat, monitoring water quality, creating a geographic information system (GIS) and educating tribal members on the cultural and ecological importance of the Pacific lamprey. Dynamic segmentation, a GIS data structure, was used to link standard stream survey data on the river unit scale to a base stream coverage (1:24,000). Dynamic segmentation efficiently associates georeferenced data to a linear feature, thus allowing the data to be readily assessable on desktop computer systems.

The program also provides youth with the education to make choices for their careers and lifestyle. Given the strong cultural influence of the Athabascan people in the area, the program also strives to balance cultural traditions with the technology for development. The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the process used in planning, implementing and evaluating a nonformal education program in a rural Athabascan village in terms of its effectiveness and cultural appropriateness. The study focused on the program in the village of Kaltag, Alaska. Using ethnographic methods guided by Coombs and Ahmed's (1974) ""Guidelines for Preparing Case Studies of Nonformal Education in Rural Areas"" and Nelson's (1982) ""Descriptive Profile of Culturally Appropriate Instructional Resources"", the study sought to provide a rich description of the program so that other villages of the region and state can determine whether or not a similar program would benefit the youth in their community. Respondents in this study indicated the program was both effective and culturally appropriate. Three themes related to cultural appropriateness emerged during this study: 1) community support, 2) relevance to community needs, and 3) program integration with the school. These themes are interrelated and interdependent and are related to the program's effectiveness and cultural appropriateness. In addition, the program's transferability to other communities may be determined by these three themes. Recommendations for further study include a comparative study to determine if these same themes or others have the same importance in villages implementing the program elsewhere."

Methods for this study include key informant interviews with 70 individuals, a mail-administered survey of 209 Wallowa County landowners, review of secondary data sources, and direct observation as a member of the Wallowa County community. This case study includes a land tenure and use history of Wallowa County, a review of pertinent quantitative land ownership and use data, and analyses of the symbolic (discursive), material (land use), and political dimensions of restructuring in Wallowa County. I discuss ways in which observed patterns of land tenure and use reflect complex influences, based ultimately in class, culture, livelihood, and associated identities and environmental ideologies. I pay particular attention to the contradictory nature of narratives of land ownership, rurality, and nonhuman nature and the ways in which these affect land uses and land use politics. I close with a series of recommendations for rural communities experiencing amenity-driven property turnover."

I focus on three cultural overlays across time that together with the unique biophysical components, generate an importance for the locale to the Coquille Indian Tribe. While it is useful to record the story of the Coquille Indians and their land in its own right, their ancestral land also provides the focus for my basic premise that environmental histories viewed at the landscape level, can offer an understanding of ""the way people live on this Earth, experience the places they inhabit, and confer meaning to these experiences"" (Clavel 2001: 130). I suggest that the connectedness between the Coquille Indians and Euphoria Ridge is a specific example of countless iterations of culture-environment interactions that have transformed natural landforms, creating unique place-meaning. A clear theme emerged that the Coquille hold a very high and dear value to the connection that their local environment gives them to their ancestors and that their environmental values and actions stem from their moral obligation not to protect the environment, but to protect that ancestral connection. Euphoria Ridge holds a unique place-meaning for them as an area where their ancestors once traveled and where they can travel to become connected to their ancestral traditions. Using the theoretical framework of Memmott and Long (2002), I offer a depiction of the transformation through 1) the alteration of the environment's physical characteristics, 2) the enactment of special behaviors and emotions to a particular environment, and 3) the group knowledge of past events, legends, or memories. In this way I show the dynamic construction of the Euphoria Ridge landscape as both a specific locale and as a cultural product. Landscape studies that include complementary methodologies from across the sciences can offer a framework to perceive the great breadth and interdependency among the web of people's interactions that bond them with their environment and offer a means to reach an appropriate understanding for viable land use management and ecosystem preservation."

Information is developed to allow a contextual comparison of life in both areas. The mutual-aid groups in Edinburgh and Massachusetts Bay were different and yet similar in function and origin. Some of these organizations were indigenous; some were formed in the natural evolution of a crisis situation, such as war, imprisonment or movement to a new and foreign land. These mutual aid groups played an important part in the life adjustment of Scottish immigrants to Massachusetts. The function of mutual aid societies is examined through an individual named Alexander Stewart. He was born and raised in Edinburgh. Historical secondary data indicate he was taken prisoner by Cromwell at the Battle of Dunbar in 1650 and was sold as an indentured servant in Boston in 1651. He lived in Charlestown, Yarmouth and Marlborough, all in Massachusetts. He died in 1731 at the age of 98. He became a successful farmer and tailor, but he could not have been successful without the aid of organized societal assistance, whether it be from an ethnic community or from the family unit. The primary difference between Edinburgh and Boston was urban versus rural life style. Patterns of life style, other than the religious aspects, developed along different lines. There was more opportunity for economic advancement in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a situation that many of the Scottish prisoners were able to take advantage of, but not without the reinforcement of aid groups. Mutual aid societies, both in Edinburgh and Massachusetts Bay Colony, developed in and of themselves when the situation dictated the need, which could be social or economic, of natural evolution or of purposeful creation. This is true both in the centuries-old society of Edinburgh and in the new society of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Massachusetts Bay Colony mutual aid societies provided the environment and opportunity for Alexander Stewart to succeed in an alien new land."

In operation from 1856 to 1865, this fort served as part of a security network to protect and monitor the recently created Coast Indian Reservation. The primary responsibility of the soldiers stationed at Fort Hoskins was to keep unauthorized people out of the reservation and to keep the Native Americans on their designated lands. This thesis utilizes the historical and archaeological record to examine the lifeways of the enlisted army regular and volunteer soldiers who were stationed at the fort. Extensive examination of the archival records was used to describe military life for enlisted men in terms of daily schedules, pay, uniforms and accouterments, eating habits, and sanctioned activities. Specifically, this thesis will examine a variety of factors that help to explain the activities of enlisted men regarding daily routine, behavior, and discipline. This research shows that soldiers stationed on a remote frontier often struggled with an inadequate military supply line that provided outdated uniforms, guns and equipment, and inadequate food supplies. The struggles of frontier army life were exacerbated by a rigorous daily schedule and the high expectation of adherence to orders. Due to these struggles, soldiers found deviant means to remove themselves from the challenges of military life on the frontier."

Rooted in my personal history and enriched by the traditional teachings of my Xwlemi heritage, this work integrates Indigenous methodologies, ontologies, axiologies, and epistemologies to provide a comprehensive narrative that challenges conventional Western academic frameworks. Drawing from the profound wisdom imparted by my grandmother, Ts’tolstnomet, and my mother, Whechalie, this research emphasizes the significance of traditional place-based learning, storytelling, and the interconnectedness of all living beings. Through the lens of Indigenous epistemology, the study explores the impact of the Westernized academic model on the educational structures of the Xwlemi People, highlighting the disruption caused by forced assimilation and the U.S. government boarding school system.

As an Indigenous researcher, I employ an Indigenous research strategy that aligns with my cultural values and beliefs. This approach incorporates lived experiences, oral traditions, and spiritual insights, acknowledging the importance of relational accountability and the holistic nature of knowledge. Through interviews with family knowledge keepers and the use of Indigenous storytelling methods, I capture and analyze the cultural conflicts and barriers faced by Indigenous students in Westernized educational settings. The narrative examines my journey as a student, parent, and educator within the Ferndale School District, illustrating the persistent challenges and systemic resistance to culturally responsive methods. By merging traditional knowledge with Western research frameworks, this dissertation aims to understand the disjunction between Indigenous and Western learning styles. The work advocates for the integration of Indigenous educational practices into public schools to create inclusive and culturally responsive learning environments that empower all students. Ultimately, this dissertation serves as a testament to the transformative power of education and the resilience of Indigenous knowledge systems. It calls for reevaluating educational practices to honor and incorporate the rich cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples, fostering a future where every student can thrive regardless of their cultural background."

These same narratives influence psychological processes of ignoring history and denying racism (Nelson et al., 2012; Bonam et al., 2019) and play a part in the erasure of contemporary Indigenous peoples. We investigated how Native visibility could have an impact on interest in Native issues and systemic racism acknowledgment. When people learned about Pacific Northwest Native peoples’ past and present experiences with the environmental impact of dams, they demonstrated higher systemic racism acknowledgment through the process of having learned new information about local Native people compared to individuals who learned about the same topic with Native experiences made invisible. In addition, we aimed to understand how individual differences in personal ties to Native people and existing knowledge of PNW Native history influenced these effects. We found that individuals with closer ties with Native people tended to demonstrate more existing knowledge of PNW Native history, however, these effects did not interfere with the intervention’s ability to reduce systemic racism denial. Our findings suggest that Native visibility can enhance awareness of systemic racism and interest in contemporary Native issues, which challenges the normative state of education that often renders Native people invisible. Furthermore, we discuss how place-based history interventions may counteract identity-defensive reactions that previous research has demonstrated are related to avoidance and perpetuation of ignorance."

This subject relies on the content developed by Medin and Bang (2014) who state that an under-representation of Indigenous peoples in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields is largely the result of epistemological conflicts between educators and Indigenous students. I hypothesize that there is a considerable epistemological difference between the conservation entities developing programs to engage Native youth. These differences may create significant barriers with youth recruitment, retention, and curriculum development that in turn can lead to the possibility of ineffective programming. My thesis begins the work of identifying where conflicts can occur between conservation educators and Native youth demographics through interviews with individuals involved with NYSPs development. In this study, I found evidence suggesting greater convergence in worldviews than believed in my initial hypothesis. Representatives from all three entities agreed that successful NYSPs depend on community-driven approaches. Mistrust and insufficient time investments were also commonly identified as the most significant barrier to successful NYSPs. Finally, conservation entity representatives also agreed that NYSPs are important in fostering relationships. This work helps develop pathways to more relevant and engaging conservation programs for Native youth."

The 'successes' of these assimilation policies were well documented by contemporary federal officials, missionaries and anthropologists. Today many ethnohistorians continue to write about the history of Grand Ronde as if tribes had dissolved by the end of the 19th century. Over the last 20 years most scholars who have written on 19th century identity at Grand Ronde view identity as a social phenomenon and try to incorporate indigenous perspectives, but they rely on ethnohistorical data consisting mainly of materials written by European and European American missionaries, federal officials and anthropologists, and the people who created most of this ethnohistorical data tended to systematically exclude descriptions of seemingly ambiguous tribal adaptations in favor of descriptions of compliance or noncompliance with standardized rules or theories made according to their own essentialist administrative categories. Some of the biases inherent in this data make it into today's narratives of tribal identity at Grand Ronde."

Focusing on the political space created for indigenous intellectuals, I examine how peasant groups are re-subalternized by claims to have solved the “indigenous question.” I analyze how market relations of power produce new discourses of equal opportunity, as well as new identities (“consumers” and “producers”), and seeks to educate their desires across the class spectrum to cultivate consent for vastly unequal distributions of power. I argue this hegemony is re/produced by a broader demographic than generally acknowledged: not just elites, but subaltern groups as well.

Using Ecuador as a case study, my research offers an alternative understanding of how neoliberalism works. Dominant narratives explain the ideology using predominantly political and economic categories of analysis, describing it as a repressive force that privileges elite class projects to accumulate wealth at the expense of society at large. While I agree that neoliberalism exacerbates economic inequalities, I find that political-economic analyses fall short of explaining why hierarchies shaped by market relations of power retain legitimacy despite political revolution and change. I argue that neoliberalism works by allowing subaltern groups to create limited space for themselves through appropriation of market discourses and identities, while simultanesouly excluding the “unproductive” aspects of their subalterneity. I explore how neoliberalism educates the desires of diversely classed groups to maintain its legitimacy as a social, cultural, and political ideology."

Washington State expects students to consider indigenous peoples' perspective on United States history to be one of genocide. Given this mandate, textbooks used in Washington State are responsible for presenting that perspective. That responsibility is primarily placed on textbooks because they represent a disproportionate amount of the curricular materials used in United States history classes across the country. A sample of six textbooks representing half of those currently used in Whatcom County, Washington, was analyzed for the inclusion of best practices for genocide education when discussing indigenous peoples. Textbooks were coded using content analysis of the text, images and captions, as well as semiotic analysis of selected images and their framing on the page. Texts' representations of victims of the Holocaust were used as a basis for comparison because of their universally recognized status as victims of genocide. My findings suggest that the perspectives of both groups of victims are inadequately represented in the textbooks, but in very different ways, and that these misrepresentations could be interpreted as complicity in continuing the genocides against the two groups."

A young Blackfeet mother of five daughters had a dream she was out on the Two Medicine Buffalo Jumps on the Blackfeet reservation with her sister Elisha. They were looking for arrowheads scattered amongst old buffalo bones. The young mother looked down on the ground and spotted a red bead lying amongst the scattered buffalo bones. It was an old, old, old red bead that was a dried berry.

The First, Second, and Third Lima Councils standardized the conversion process and enforced restrictions on sacred music. Like Lima, Arequipa also had a vibrant musical culture but the music remains lost. The music during the colonial era transitioned from three phases: early Spanish, Italian, and Nationalism. Church music dominated nearly the entire epoch of the Viceroyalty. The early Spanish music had limited instrumentation and mainly used popular texts from Spain. After the arrival of the Italian composers the chapel expanded with string and wind instrumentalists. The peak of the revolution influenced patriotic songs that united all Peruvians for the cause."

Tribal interests often extend beyond the boundaries of the reservation and into the county space where they may be affected by county and local government planning. Properly integrating tribal interest into regional comprehensive planning is necessary to reduce conflict and provide Indian tribes a seat at the government table.

The purpose of this project is to determine the extent to which planning laws, regulations, and policies within Washington State advance coordination with Indian tribes based on the government-to-government principles of the Centennial Accord, particularly those relating to the implementation of the state’s Growth Management Act (GMA). This project assesses the state’s legislative framework directing local governments in comprehensive planning with tribal governments and the adequacy of the state’s encouragement regarding tribal participation in the Growth Management Act comprehensive planning. This project is primarily concerned with determining if Washington State’s public policies adequately incorporate the interests of Indian tribes and allow for appropriate inclusion of tribal governments into regional planning, as outlined in the Growth Management Act’s eleventh goal.

This project utilizes template analysis for the identification of thematic codes in determining relevant laws and regulations. Initial templates were defined on review of relevant literature and prior knowledge of tribal interests. Initial templates were revised to further assess the data for relevant themes using codes for mandatory language and modes of participation. Secondary codes were cross-referenced with relevant literature and scholarly articles on cooperative planning with Indian tribes and planning principles.

The findings indicate a lack of GMA policies providing guidance to local governments regarding coordination with tribal governments. The small number of GMA policies also lack clear and precise language regarding the capacity with which local governments should cooperate with tribes. Ultimately, the GMA policies fail to adequately institute the guiding principles of the Centennial Accord. For the state to fulfill the GMA’s interjurisdictional coordination goal and more fully incorporate tribal government interest into regional planning structures, the GMA must be amended with clear and precise language regarding tribal inclusion in comprehensive planning and in what capacity. This project identifies possible amendments based on communicative and cooperative mechanisms within the Centennial Accord."

I ask, how might differing narratives affect progress and reflect the ontological orientations of the fishery’s co-stewards? Asked with a twist, Who is Nature? (abbreviated Who’s Nature?), I aim to critique the classic Euro-American paradigm of nature and examine the connections between us, the who, and natural world? I hope my research illuminates these important questions. I selected three entities with varying Euro-American and Indigenous affiliations—the Skagit Watershed Council (SWC), Skagit River System Cooperative (SRSC), and Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission (NWIFC)—and then used Narrative Policy Framework to analyze literary devices of scale, villains, and victims in four publicly available documents from each entity. The results highlighted a statistically significant difference in who coalitions victimize. The SWC and SRSC only victimized nature, while the NWIFC portrayed both nature and humans as victims of ecological degradation and struggling salmon populations. I believe this dissonance is rooted in conceptions of humans as either separate from, or part of nature—perspectives that have implications for fisheries management, conservation policies and the future of salmon. If we continue to ignore these fundamental ontological differences, collaborative approaches are likely to fail, and the salmon crisis will only worsen."

Indigenous evaluation frameworks have been generally described as participatory, culturally responsive, and reflecting community contexts. However, there remains a gap in knowledge about Indigenous evaluation conceptualizations, appropriate application of inquiry methods, and current and historical tensions that may limit the use and capacity of this emerging framework. Previous reviews on Indigenous program evaluation have limited their scope to health and wellness programs, extent of literature, and have not explored issues of power and policy regulations often imposed by outside funding agencies. In this systematic review of 39 articles, I provide a comprehensive summary of major and minor themes found to conceptualize Indigenous program evaluation approaches, frameworks, and models. Additionally, I identified Indigenous and Western mainstream methods that are used and recommended by Indigenous evaluation practitioners. Lastly, I explore issues of power and tensions that have shaped theory and practice, and how those critical issues are framing the future of Indigenous evaluation. The analysis of literature selected for this systematic review will help non-Indigenous evaluators, policy makers, and funding agencies become familiar with Indigenous community protocols and contextual factors important for relationship building and utilization. This dissertation concludes with recommendations for advancing an Indigenous evaluation framework that is responsive to community needs and satisfies funding agencies requirements."

To address NHPIs’ health disparities, Pacific Islander health practitioners and community leaders have worked together to create preventative interventions and health programs that are more culturally-aligned. Although this is an important and exciting step forward, the centering of culturally-significant protective factors in healthcare and preventative health programs is still an emerging field, particularly regarding protective factors of connection to place and traditional food. This qualitative study explored the role of connection to place and traditional food in health and well-being through a secondary analysis of interviews with five multigenerational Pacific Islander families (14 participants total) around experiences with the healthcare and education systems. Using thematic analysis of the interviews, two major themes emerged around health and well-being: the importance of education and awareness to improve care for NHPIs, and the right to self-determination. Findings also revealed two themes around connection to place and traditional food: disconnection to place and traditional food are risk factors, and traditional food strengthens family relationships and cultural connectedness. The implications for future research in prevention science are discussed."

The literature available on these programs is growing, and outcomes show promise for Indigenous youth wellbeing. More research is needed, however, on how to design, implement and evaluate them. This dissertation aims to add to the knowledge base of prevention programs for Indigenous youth. Manuscript one is a scoping review of outdoor and land-based prevention programs for Indigenous youth that explores the extent of programs that exist, their characteristics, and the degree to which programs have undergone formal research studies. Manuscript two provides case studies of ten diverse, effective, outdoor and land-based programs and further examines common characteristics through an Indigenous framework for wellbeing. Lastly, manuscript three is a qualitative study of youth and parent perceptions of the core components of an outdoor program for Indigenous youth. The findings of these three studies may be a guide for Indigenous communities that seek to develop programs to promote the wellbeing of their youth."

Most behavioral health research and programs, including suicide prevention among Indigenous Peoples, are rooted in a Eurocentric worldview and positivist research paradigm, but calls to “decolonize” public health are growing. Consistent with decolonial practices, Indigenous voices and perspectives must be centered in the development and evaluation of suicide prevention programs for Indigenous Peoples of the United States (IPoUS). Qualitative and data storytelling research approaches further support the uprooting of settler-colonial perspectives and align with a social justice orientation. The current study is a meta-synthesis of qualitative research on suicide prevention among Indigenous populations in the United States. Findings conclude little evidence for the centering of participant voices in the work. Applied thematic analysis surfaced 4 primary themes: (1) support preferences; (2) challenges to suicide prevention; (3) integration of culture as prevention; and (4) grounding relationships in prevention. The need for culturally centered programming and the inadequacy of ‘pan-Indian’ approaches are highlighted. Sub-themes highlight resiliency, kinship connection, and safe spaces to share cultural knowledge also emerge. Similar protective and risk factors for service utilization are addressed across subpopulations are also discussed. Implications of this work will further the decolonization of suicide prevention and aid in the promotion of culturally grounded prevention science strategies. Preventative programs that aim to mitigate suicide risk within Indigenous communities will be strengthened by grounding in an Indigenous Ways of Knowing framework to understand resilience and healing."

Schneider and Hayes (2020) advocate for a shift towards critical Indigenous theory and the “undisciplining” of archaeology. This dissertation therefore investigates the archaeological past outside of archaeology, by operationalizing an Indigenous research paradigm for zooarchaeological research. My research integrates oral history, ethnography, academic publications, and contemporary Tribal insight with critical Indigenous theory to address archaeological research questions within a paradigm defined explicitly by Coquille ontology. In 2018, the Coquille Indian Tribe (CIT) Cultural Resource Program performed data recovery and salvage work at site 35CS331, a shell midden inadvertently discovered during the construction of a private home in Bandon, OR. To demonstrate the analytical flexibility and robustness of practicing archaeology within an Indigenous research paradigm, I present three separate, but interrelated, case studies. The first case focuses on the sea mammal assemblage, with particular attention to the personal nature of Coquille relationships to their animal kin and its implications for choosing data and defining the scale of research. Second, I approach the shellfish assemblage by focusing on the ecological relationships between taxa and not solely their relative quantities. This reveals a strategy for intertidal management based on highly sophisticated and fine-grained ecological knowledge to balance the needs of current and future generations of both humans and shellfish. Finally, I synthesize the zooarchaeological assemblage with the rest of the data from 35CS331 and conclude not only that the primary shell midden deposit is associated with a single feasting event, but that the feast was embedded within a broader web of reciprocal gifting relationships that structured socioecological life for Coquille ancestors and their animal relatives."

The engaged ethnobiology in the Maya area presented herein investigates variation in ethnobotanical knowledge and praxis, traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), and traditional gastronomy in Guatemalan and southern Mexican communities using collaborative and applied ethnographic methods. It uses researcher’s and locals’ relationships and the information generated through research as catalysts to document, preserve, and revitalize traditional knowledge for the sake of current and future generations. Indigenous groups are actively working towards increased vitality and wellbeing in their communities, demonstrating the dynamic nature of local people to confront challenges and envision and create new futures. Engaged ethnobiologists can assist these efforts by contributing their ethnographic and natural science skills, and using their positionality as an outsider-insider to document TEK and share it, with whom and where it is appropriate, as decided in collaboration with local and Indigenous peoples. The work herein presents a series of case studies of these research processes and applied outcomes.The first study, “Homegarden Variation and Medicinal Plant Sharing Among the Q’eqchi’ Maya of Guatemala,” is a cultural-ecological study of Santa Lucía village home- gardening practices. It finds that a household’s distance from the main road and earning income at home (e.g., a shop) significantly predict medicinal plants in homegardens. Households cultivate various of the 200 + village homegarden species. Families share herbal medicines with kin and neighbors, to intra-village ecological, medical and social advantage. 
Study two, “Guatemalan Maya Q’eqchi’ Seasonal Calendar: Methods to Monitor Climate Change Locally,” examines how Santa Lucía villagers fathom local indicators of climate change. In response to villagers’ concerns surrounding ongoing weather pattern changes they identify as climate change driven, A. Medinaceli and I documented local traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of queues and timing for local climate- and subsistence-related activities as a baseline for monitoring future activities and emic climate-related observations. We offer our methods to learn this TEK, and to design a visual seasonal calendar, intended as a locally-accessible tool to document monthly climate observations, agricultural and home garden activities, hunting, animal raising, and cultural activities during a complete annual cycle. 
Study 3 (Chapter 4) presents team research conducted in the villages adjacent to Chiapas, Mexico’s Parque Nacional Lagunas de Montebello (Montebello Lakes National Park, PNLM). It is a methods paper espousing collaborative Transformational Research (Schensul et al. 2014), an applied anthropology, participatory research methodological and theoretical orientation for researching local issues collaboratively while acknowledging the global-systemic context catalyzing those issues. Maya and Mestizo community residents and PNLM advisors called for park support in revitalizing traditional gastronomy to promote food sovereignty because commercial foods threaten to replace local foods and prevent continued traditional food and environmental learning. Our research team trained residents and park affiliates in ethnography to partner in recording traditional foodways, cuisine, and culinary practices. We offer samples of our resulting digital database and “recipe” videos that support local efforts towards gastronomic revitalization and continued engagement of communities in relevant research."

Grounded in the lived experiences of Queer and/or Transgender Pacific Islander (QTPI) activists, OceanCRT builds upon three distinct theoretical frameworks: Queer Indigenous studies (Barker, 2017; Driskill, Finley, Gilley & Morgensen, 2011), Pacific studies (Hau‘ofa, 1993, 2008; Teaiwa, 2001 & 2010; Wendt, 1982; Wesley-Smith, T, 1995; Wood, 2003), and Critical Race Theory (Brayboy, 2006; Delgado & Stefancic, 2012; Ladson-Billings, 1998; Solórzano, 1998; Solórzano & Yosso, 2001 & 2002; Wright & Balutski, 2016). Used in isolation from each other, these frameworks do not help researchers and educators understand the unique experiences of Oceanians or Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI) in the US. In addition, the lived experiences and unique knowledge of Queer and/or Transgender Pacific Islander (QTPI) activists are often neglected when considering Oceanic populations, which contributes to normalizing heteronormative Oceanic Indigenous ideas of gender and sexuality (Barker, 2017; Driskill et al., 2011). 
Therefore, this research project uses Talanoa (Vaioleti, 2006) as an Oceanic Indigenous research methodology to center the knowledge of QTPI activists to disrupt oppressive systems. While OceanCRT is an emerging theoretical framework with 3 main ideas that are articulated as ocean currents, this projects explores the first and main ocean current, which is “vā,” a relational space (Wendt, 1996). The findings include a nuanced and deeper understanding of vā, as a relational space, by exploring how QTPIs relate to society in three spaces: 1) K-12 spaces, 2) Christian spaces, and 3) Queer and/or Pacific Islander spaces. The ultimate goal of OceanCRT is to continue addressing institutional and interpersonal oppression of Oceanians in order to contribute towards a more equitable and just world."

In Chapter 1, I consider that settlers possess a structural power imbalance and can be violent before exchange. I find that they are strategically violent to more cost-effectively appropriate Indigenous peoples' lands. In addition, uncertainty about whether an agreement can ensure the avoidance of all-out conflict, affects initial violence and resistance; its effect depends on whether the Indigenous people can seek compensation. Chapter 1 underscores that even when settlers offer compensation, the land exchanges are fundamentally coercive. 
Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 are concerned with efforts to support growers' collective action to mitigate fungicide resistance. Fungicide resistance threatens grape growers' ability to achieve disease control through fungicide-based management. Each chapter considers that not all grape growers have access to accurate information about its severity. Chapter 2 contributes to the literature that provides insight into the strategic behavior of growers in the presence of fungicide resistance modeled as a negative intertemporal production externality. Considering a growers' agreement that requires one grower to reduce his fungicide use and be compensated by the other, I show that it induces the socially optimal level in complete information; when one grower is misinformed about fungicide resistance severity, it generates distortions. 
In Chapter 3, using a signaling game approach, I determine the conditions required for supporting an agreement similar to Chapter 2 in an incomplete information setting. The agreement can be supported if the compensation for fungicide reduction offsets the loss in benefits of deviating from the agreement and penalties for failing to compensate are sufficiently great. In this context, information is transferred to the uninformed grower about the true fungicide resistance severity. If the uninformed grower has sufficiently high beliefs that fungicide is severe regardless of the fungicide level applied by the informed grower, who is compensated sufficiently more for choosing low in severe resistance, then the agreement is not maintained; that is, the informed grower always applies a low level of fungicide."

For a long time, Mourning Dove was believed to be the first Indigenous woman in North America to publish a novel. Much of Mourning Dove scholarship focuses on the ways that Lucullus McWhorter, her editor for the novel Cogewea, interrupts her narrative. The novel was originally to be published around 1918-1919 but was delayed. Mourning Dove herself believed the delay was because of the war and rising prices. This thesis covers a reading of Mourning Dove letters that suggest McWhorter may have caused the delay in publication. The thesis also performs a textual analysis on the novel’s first chapter. Finally, memoir, poetry and a close textual reading of the snake scene come together in an alternate reading that suggests that the scene may not have ever happened if not for the mis-mailed manuscript and the delay in publication."

Like those famous regions, most of the vineyards in Washington state are grown under a denomination of origin, predominately the Columbia Valley American Viticultural Area (AVA). This legally designated agricultural area spans the majority of Washington state, covering a vast swath of land east of the Cascade mountain range, flanking the Columbia River. The creation of this wine region follows old stories of wine cultivation and consumption, as well as international trade habits of the Global North. In this dissertation, I explore the creation of the Columbia Valley American Viticultural Area as a story of ongoing rhetorical encounters that take place in the land surrounding the Columbia River, in order to describe settler place-making practices and the anti-colonial efforts that resist those actions. I explore how the region’s rhetorical and material construction furthered the colonial project through the installment and naturalization of white settler presence in the Columbia Valley. The impositions of Western epistemologies of place sought to erase Indigenous sovereignty and replace reciprocal land relationships with extractive practices. Following Audra Simpson, I argue that the establishment of this region represents incomplete and unsuccessful colonization, that these colonial efforts have been and continue to be resisted and refused. At the heart of this work are questions of what land is to humans, who has the power to define those relationships, and how land becomes place through these narratives. The story of how we can and should relate to the earth is an essential part of how we understand place and our place within the world. The broad goal of this work is to untangle how the Columbia Valley was symbolically formed as a means to re-assemble the lands, waters, and peoples within a colonial relational scheme."

Documentation exists, but much of the framing of this regional history is one-sided, and part of what Feagin describes as the “white racial framing” (2013) of the origin story of Washington Territory. Using counter-narrative and critical analysis I trouble the narrative of my own pioneer past as a 5th generation Washingtonian, and my present as a critical multicultural scholar and educator. As such, this dissertation is a qualitative narrative inquiry that draws on historical research methods to tell the story of family history—a settler colonial subjectivity—juxtaposed against the Indigenous culture and history that was disrupted and displaced as part of colonization. As part of the narrative inquiry, I had an ongoing dialogue with Alex Kuo, a long-time Washington state poet, scholar, and mentor as the narrative takes shape in response to my responsibility as a critical multicultural educator to unsettling my subjectivities and historical roots. While “another pioneer family history” might seem to be a well-covered subject, approaching this history by contextualizing and de-centering it with tribal history, particularly the Indian Removal Act and subsequent federal acts that “opened” the territory to settlement, and the effect that had on local tribes has not been covered in this way. 
Using Critical Race Theory, TribalCrit Theory, and Critical Multiculturalism as the theoretical and conceptual frameworks, I examine the settler colonial roots of qualitative research, which pave the way for using narrative inquiry as my methodology. Histories of the Palus, the context of that history within the broader histories of Indigenous histories vis a vis settler colonialism and westward expansion, and how my family and history is complicit in settler colonialism form the initial phase of my narrative inquiry. My contribution to the narrative inquiry includes six vignettes that illustrate my journey as a critical multicultural educator and the events and people that influenced me. My hope is that the work I do in this dissertation can be useful for future Critical Multicultural Educators."

In this dissertation, I explore how specific forms of knowledge – epistemologies – have structured archaeological inquiry and interpretation. Human-plant relationships are primarily viewed from strictly evolutionary perspectives, despite the vast body of epistemological and philosophical literature which highlights how Indigenous people engage with and understand plants in very different ways. Here, I focus on the bulbous geophyte plant foods, also sometimes referred to as underground storage organs or root crops, that were and continue to be critical in the subsistence practices and the overall health of Columbia Plateau residents. This dissertation consists of three paleoethnobotanical studies foregrounding Northwest bulbs. The first study establishes baseline paleoethnobotanical identification criteria, key traits, and reference data for eleven of the most ethnographically consumed bulbs of the greater Northwest region. In the second paper, I draw on that botanical knowledge and develop a method of testing for precontact plant stewardship practices using bulb life-history traits. I examine archived camas bulbs from the Pend Oreille Valley, Washington State, to show how these bulbs were selectively harvested and managed for much of the past 3500 years. The third paper takes a closer look at Pend Oreille Valley earth ovens, the features that many of these bulbs were prepared within. Earth ovens are commonly assumed to be representative of bulb or other geophyte processing and have been used as direct proxies for tracking increased camas production in the inland Northwest. My analysis of archived soil samples from the same valley illustrates that these ovens processed and prepared a wide variety of plant taxa, including several species of bulbs, berries, and pine nuts.

The dissertation focuses on attempts of cultural preservation in this cross-border setting with a specific focus on the traditional Sin-Aikst People who are today represented by the unrecognized Sinixt Nation in Canada and the Lakes Peoples of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. The role of women in these cross-border movements for cultural preservation are a main focus of the dissertation. Geographically the research focuses on the western United States and Canada along the U.S.-Canadian border in British Columbia and Washington State. The United States and the British Empire established the border between the western United States and Canada with the Anglo-American Convention of 1818 and the 1846 Oregon Treaty. Women played significant roles in preserving Indigenous cultures and languages, but their roles have mostly been overlooked by scholars. The tribal connections across the U.S.-Canadian border impacted the way those women protected their cultural heritage. They learned from each other about traditions, legends, folktales, and through this were able to protect their cultural heritage for future generations. The experience of women like Mourning Dove was immensely impacted by the different timelines of assimilation attempts in the western United States and Canada, as Mourning Dove was able to access traditional Sin-Aikst knowledge more freely on the Canadian side of the border than on the United States side. The dissertation adds to the historiographies of transnationalism with its focus on “transnational” Indigenous communities crossing the U.S.-Canadian border and the resistance across international boundaries towards assimilation attempts in the United States and Canada during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."

AN Elders possess a rich understanding of historical events. This study aims to identify the meaning and relative activities of resiliency, strength, and purposefulness as perceived by AN Sugpiaq Elders. Method: Eleven Elders shared their storied-narratives describing resiliency, strength, and purposefulness. A decolonizing framework was used throughout the study process, with a primary focus on individual and collective strengths. Storied-narratives were analyzed using an Indigenous method reflective of the whole story and a non-Indigenous method of thematic identification. Findings from these two approaches provided a multi-faceted tapestry of resiliency, strength, and purposefulness as perceived by AN Elders. Results: An overarching theme of collectiveness was predominant throughout the storied-narratives. Additional themes inclusive of the (1) Russian Orthodox religion, (2) getting back to the old ways, (3) Elder love and pride, (4) living in two worlds, and (5) the power of nature depicted a cyclical relationship between resiliency, strength, and purposefulness for the individual and community. Discussion: Results showed that the Elders of this community intertwined their personal resiliency, strength, and purposefulness with that of the community into a collective whole. They asserted the concept of resiliency is not static. It is instead a process of developing pathways throughout life to counteract the challenges of personal and socio-political factors. Findings from this study provide valuable information for future strength-based wellness programs and a foundation for additional resiliency research with Alaska Native peoples."

In this Arts-Based narrative the experimental writing reflects field trips to Mexico in which inspiration was found to discover new meanings in spirituality, religion, love, sexuality, race, and how to overcome recent traumatic experiences including a near death hospitalization. Intergenerational trauma as an African descendant from Brasil is also addressed as well as systematic oppression experienced in Brasil, Mexico, and in the USA. Quetzalcóatl and La Coatlicue, two Mexica non-binary deities who are archetypes of wisdom, transformation, and the dynamics of the universe, reflect deepest aspirations and anxieties and inspiration to walk in life being a person with conflicting marginalized identities. In this narrative I talk about fear, despair, and pain, but also about joy, pleasure, and healing. Through this personal journey, I express my voice in a non-linear and fragmented way inspired by Mexican and Brazilian popular poetry with visual representations that seeks for a dialogue among cultures and spiritualities to create new possibilities of community building. The aim is not to essentialize the intersectionalities that can be so painful but find the beauty and awakening moments for those who have them. This narrative is connecting with decolonial pedagogies to encourage students and people in general with marginalized identities to come forward in classrooms and in life and share their histories denouncing systematic oppression and healing from its wounds. This counter storytelling is an experiment of academic and poetic voices looking for a queer and feminist future that breaks binaries, embracing fluidity and constant change as ways of expressing yourself and being who you are."

Anchored in deconstructing of the role of the Creek Confederacy, led by legendary “Negotiating Chief” Alexander McGillivray, and the stymying of the Six Nations, led by “War Chief” Joseph Brant, this project highlights the effectiveness of these tribal leaders in holding vast tracts of land in the face of Anglo-American aggression largely without having to resort to using military force. Similarly, this study underscores the instability of the fledgling federal government, particularly through the diplomatic failings of the American Founding Fathers, and its inability to adequately control former colonial outposts along the frontier. Further embedded in this argument is a deeper look into the disagreements between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson concerning the fate and status of indigenous populations and their treatment. This project also aims to prove that although the final cascading blow to indigenous power at the edges of the American frontier came from those traditionally associated with “Indian Removal,” removal policies were nonetheless rooted deep in the construction of a governmental framework from this era that eventually allowed the removal of tribes along the frontier to take place The result of this study is not to determine whether Native American leadership triumphed or failed during this time, but to show the shift in the paradigm tribal leaders faced along the frontier. It also aims to complicate the underchallenged assumptions made about early American leadership, including that the American government could readily will its way to authority over Native Americans, or that the westward expansion of American “settlers” was inevitable."

Through the years, I have become more conscious of how my ways of knowing and being are primarily a colonial experience, and what I am particularly interested in is how this colonial experience is realized and enacted on an island situated among other colonized. This dissertation is a rhetorical analysis of how Filipinos on Guåhan enunciate ourselves in matters of self, community, and politics, as colonial settlers. Using Walter Mignolo’s theoretical framework of enunciation to delink from Western epistemologies, I foreground the complex, intertwined histories of colonization in the Philippines and in Guåhan, the shared experience of colonial legacies on the island, and the social movements that demonstrate a shared commitment toward decolonization. This work draws on a range of research methods, including being a participant observer, rhetorically analyzing the texts and movements emerging from a community that I myself identify with, and, most importantly, studying ongoing dialogue between the Filipino community on Guåhan and the public. Filipinos on Guåhan together navigate belonging, culture, community, and politics discursively, and decolonial epistemologies unsettle these discourses. My purpose in studying the rhetorics of the politics of my community is two-fold: (1) to explore the possibilities of contributing productively and respectfully to a decolonial epistemology on Guåhan and (2) to frame decolonial activism in a critical collective subjectivity that delinks from the colonial matrix of power and re-members concepts of home, community, nation, and liberation with inafa’maolek—the foundation of CHamoru culture predicated on respect, generosity, and reciprocity."

A total of five first-generation Chicanx women, both currently enrolled or already graduated from a predominantly white university in the Pacific North West, participated in a two-and-a-half-day digital testimonios workshop. The testimoniadoras collectively learned how to create their digital testimonios using digital devices and software with my guidance. As a way to honor the stories of the testimoniadoras, their narratives were not subject to the typical western research analysis. Instead, I, the ""researcher"" share my testimonio as a first-generation Chicanx woman ""facilitating"" this workshop and examining my own assumptions and understandings of being what is typically called the ""researcher"". I drew from Anzaldúa's (2012) borderlands framework and Indigenous epistemologies to guide me through this reflection process. My testimonio of the experience being the ""facilitator"" of this workshop speaks to the constant splitting of selves and research purposes found in western research paradigms. It also focuses on the importance of centering relationships in the workshop journey of creating the digital and written testimonios. This work supports the rejection of dominant research practices which have marginalized the voices and experiences of those who do not fit mainstream white society. This work also speaks to the importance of centering relations when working with first-generation Chicanx women, as well as the importance of not subjecting their stories/testimonios to the gaze of dominant Western research analysis. There is important knowledge to learn from groups that have been relegated to the margins if administrators at PWIs allowed themselves to hear their narratives to inform the much-needed changes in predominantly white institutions of education to move towards a more equitable education for all students."

American Indians have been affected by COVID-19 at higher rates than other racial groups. In a study of 14 participating states, COVID-19 associated mortality among American Indian populations was 1.8 times higher than non-Hispanic Whites. COVID-19 vaccinations are the primary tool to end the pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy continues to be a barrier to wide-spread vaccination among the greater US population. The goal of this study is to provide insight into perceptions of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines among American Indians. To examine perceptions, we completed 30 in-depth, face-to-face interviews with American Indians residing on the Nez Perce Indian Reservation. The reservation is located in north-central Idaho and is the home of the Nimiipuu people. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a combination of deductive and inductive approaches were used to identify and analyze themes related to risk perceptions.Indigenous Ways of Knowing and the Health Belief Model provided the theoretical framework used to explore risk perceptions of COVID-19 and the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccinations. We focus on the six primary Health Belief Model constructs. The constructs include: Perceived susceptibility and severity, perceived benefits and risks, cues to action and self-efficacy. 
Results show that perceptions of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccinations were heavily influenced by cultural knowledge and understanding. It was clear that American Indians believed they were susceptible, and felt that the severity of contracting the disease was high. The majority also believed in the science behind vaccines, and trusted tribal sources of information about COVID-19 and vaccinations. The results demonstrate the importance of tribal sovereignty in developing health communication strategies, and the need for messaging that is trusted and culturally congruent. Our conclusions include recommendations for future risk perception studies, and provide guiding principles for health communication with American Indians."

In that light, there is a lot to learn about imperial mechanisms and evolutions, and to see how communities survive, resist, and defy the ever-evolving pillars of empire.  From the late 19th century to today, Pacific peoples from the islands of the Philippines, Hawai‘i, Guåhan (Guam), and Samoa have at varying times resisted and struggled against colonization and imperialism by Spain, Germany, Japan, and the United States governments.  With love and rage, Pacific peoples have fought back and resisted all imperial oppressions and continue to struggle in the pursuit of liberation.  This dissertation will examine historical and contemporary storytelling, poetry, and lyrics of Filipinos and Pacific Islanders as they and their diaspora intersect with U.S. empire.  Focusing on 20th and 21st century cultural productions, I will investigate what they reveal about U.S. imperialism, militarism, immigration policies, carceral systems, racialization, gendering, state violence, and capitalism.  Using Pacific peoples’ cultural productions as a lens to scrutinize empire, we can see what resonates through space and time.  Some of the artists looked at in this project are Bambu, Emcee Klassy, Terisa Siagatonu, The Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E., Faith Santilla, Julian Aguon, and Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner.  Ultimately, these cultural productions are part of a fueling for cultures of defiance.  Geographical emphasis is on the U.S. continental west coast in efforts to contribute to the literature in Transpacific Studies in connecting islands, the west coast, and diaspora in the study of the intersections/connections between all imperialized communities and the ever-evolving condition of empire they confront and continue to defy."

From variable researcher training, to outdated cataloging and descriptive practices, to institutional paradigms for research and collaboration, archives are endlessly impacted by the ideals and practices of the stakeholders who interact with them. Far from neutral repositories of mere-information awaiting discovery, archives – and, by extension, the historiographical work derived from them – persuade us to adopt a particular orientation to both the stories and voices held within the historical record and those not-so-conspicuously left out of it. Via two emblematic case studies, and with particular guidance from Qwo-Li Driskill (Cherokee) and bell hooks, I endeavor to answer: why do we need to decolonize archives and what would a decolonial archival praxis really look like?"

Retention of NA students is important for addressing inequities in the monetary, personal, societal, and health benefits associated with obtaining a degree (Trostel, 2015). Tribal Critical Race Theory, a theoretical framework that guides this study, posits that colonization is endemic to society, and that story is inseparable from theory (Brayboy, 2005). This theoretical framework puts the colonial framework of higher education into perspective and calls for the centering of NA voices and stories to work towards an equitable education for NA students (Brayboy, 2005). Qualitative methods of data collection and analysis were utilized to center the stories and lived experiences of 11 self-identifying NA students at a white-majority land grant university in the Pacific Northwest. Four focus groups across three campuses were conducted in the spring semester of 2023. These focus groups centered questions regarding community and inclusion, representation, racial and ethnic identity, and definitions of belongingness. Findings revealed three major themes that support belongingness including reciprocal relationships, connection on campus, and individual supports. In addition, barriers to belongingness were identified, revealing four themes including racist attitudes, racist cultural schema, and both pre-existing and perpetuated racism, based on the types of racism defined by Shiao and Woody (2021).

The purpose of this analysis is to use archaeobotanical methodologies, emphasizing starch grain analysis, to address questions of women’s household production through a dialectic framework of gender and status. Women are often discussed in Pacific Northwest archeological research as undifferentiated household producers. However, their roles in household production likely varied based on the intersections of gender and status. This thesis reanalyzes the macrobotanical assemblage from Ozette to address the distribution of botanical remains using the framework of this gender-status dialectic. Reanalysis of the Ozette data demonstrates how botanical remains can be used to identify different activity areas within houses where women were likely producing plant-based resources. After establishing a methodology for starch grain extraction from archaeological tools, a similar framework was applied to Meier and Cathlapotle by conducting a starch analysis of ground stone tools. A variety of starch grains were observed in the 44 samples taken from groundstone tools including bowls, pestles, groundstones, mortars and net weights. The starch type with the most starch grains observed is tentatively identified as the culturally important wapato (Sagittaria latifolia). The distribution of these samples and tools at Meier suggests that women were processing plants in the central to southern portions or low-status areas of the house. Other groundstone tools associated with fishing and construction were located primarily in the northern or high-status area of the house. The Cathlapotle samples included two unique starch grain types in the highest-status area of House 1 indicating that women may have been processing plants not accessible to others at Cathlapotle. This analysis addresses women’s household production by demonstrating the differences in production activities that women were participating in within their households, and how status likely played a role in what and where plant resources were processed within these houses. Starch grain analysis is shown as a useful methodology for addressing challenging questions surrounding gender and production on the Northwest Coast. It is important to address these questions to gain a full picture of the political economies in the region during the precontact period."

However, there is a dearth of published research about substance-use treatment and its efficacy for AI people with OUD. People with OUD, especially those with a longer substance use history, often have widely variable experiences in their access to and engagement in substance-use treatment. Furthermore, there are currently no studies of AI people’s perceptions of their substance-use treatment experiences. This study seeks to fill this research gap. Specifically, conventional content analysis was utilized to highlight prevailing themes characterizing the perceptions of substance-use treatment among AI people with OUD as well as their visions for the enhancement of substance-use treatment moving forward. Key themes about participants’ experiences with past substance-use treatment included: means of navigating logistical challenges, intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation for recovery, treatment providing respite versus disciplinary environments, connection to nonjudgmental counselors and peers with lived experience, and comprehensive psychoeducation. Findings indicated that substance-use treatment should be enhanced through the provision of: robust individual and group counseling options, healing settings that include nature and flexible structures, additional social services that go beyond substance-use treatment (e.g., housing and vocational training), and the incorporation of Native-centric cultural programming."

The first case study establishes sustained long-distance interactions and connections between cultural groups in southern California and the U.S. Southwest, and uses complimentary big picture approaches to demonstrate how systemic linkages between the two regions mutually influenced sociopolitical processes and historic trajectories. The second case study compares the organizational capacity of the hierarchical Chumash and heterarchical Yuman-speaking people of California through an analysis of warfare events and economic transactions, and recognizes that different forms of sociopolitical organization can organize at comparative levels of complexity. The third paper explores the multifarious relationships people in California and the Pacific Northwest had with their watercraft by operationalizing a multitheory that overcomes the limitations of singular theoretical frameworks. It reveals watercraft as power-rendering to elites, resistance apparatuses, regional enforcers, actors in entangled networks, sentient beings and family members, relational homologies, as well as other complex meaningful concepts. Altogether, the holistic anthropological archaeology approach I employ allows for new conceptualizations of histories through analyses of the connections people established with their neighbors near and far, the organizational capacities of conflict and exchange, and the dynamic relationships people experienced with non-humans."

In this thesis, I develop the concept of a planetary caring politics, a material-discursive practice that considers how systems and structures such as heteropatriarchy, the nuclear family, racial capitalism, colonialism, and technology intersect and consequently shape the situated knowledges that inform how we conceptualize and practice care, and for whom we conceptualize and practice care. I offer interdisciplinary readings of selected literary texts to analyze their representations of planetary caring politics, as well as how these texts function on a narratological plane to shape how the reader understands the role of planetary caring politics in their own life."

The first chapter introduces CAS and how it can be used as a theoretical approach. The second chapter presents the first case study, which utilizes global-scale social complexity data to examine the variables influencing the development of hierarchy for small-, middle-, and large- scale societies. This study confirmed previous ideas proposed by Gregory Johnson regarding increases in hierarchy with increases in scale. Additionally, this study provided additional details regarding which developments in information processing (e.g., texts) that enabled societies to further increase in scale. The second case study, examined in Chapter Three, utilizes household floor area data to make inferences about the level of wealth-based inequality within ancestral Pueblo society and contextualizes them with data from the Hopi village of Orayvi (c. 1900). Wealth disparities fluctuated prehistorically, particularly in the Chaco Canyon and Chuska Valley, surpassing those observed at Orayvi prior to the 1906 split. The third case study combines household area with faunal data to explore whether there were any differences in meat-based subsistence based on relative wealth as approximated by household area. Several patterns emerge indicating that the Pueblo I period emphasized equality through leveling mechanisms such as feasting, followed by behaviors in the Pueblo II period emphasizing competition in the context of increasing wealth disparities and violence. The final chapter (Chapter 5) draws conclusions from these studies that inform how CAS approaches can benefit archaeological studies of social organization."

This is certainly the case for archaeology, where professional practice informs the way that we think about and communicate the human past. This dissertation examines how one critical aspect of sociopolitics and human identity—gender—and its intersections with other forms of status and identity reflexively influence and are influenced by: 1) engagement with archaeological practice and the communication of knowledge, and 2) the societies and lifeways that archaeologists interpret in the archaeological record. It focuses on case studies from western North America and North America at large, bridging feminist epistemologies with the evidential constraints of empirical data. It begins with a critical evaluation of feminist and gender approaches to archaeology in the Pacific Northwest, from which numerous research gaps in the archaeological study of gender are identified and taken to task in subsequent case studies. Next, this dissertation examines gender and occupational affiliation equity issues and their impacts on multivocality and the dissemination of knowledge in archaeological publishing in both western North America and greater North America. Finally, this dissertation turns to the critical roles that women, family cooperation, and childcare considerations played in hunter-gatherer plant and storage economies and settlement patterns in the Late Holocene on the Southern Plateau. These three independent, yet connected studies provide a framework for exploring gender in the archaeological past and present in western North America and elsewhere, and demonstrate the importance of considering the critical variable of gender and its intersections with other forms of identity, including age, status, and professional occupation, through feminist approaches and scientific data."

One of these is a small herd on Hall Mountain in the Sullivan Lake area of the Pend Oreille Valley. Conservation efforts of the herd have been ongoing for decades and in 2016 the Kalispel Tribe of Indians aided in the effort, however future involvement is under review. Utilizing a palaeobiological conservation framework, I analyze questions about procurement strategies that may have been implemented in the past and why they were not potentially included as a subsistence resource for the entire Kalispel Tribe ethnographically and ethnohistorically. Utilizing ethnographic data and archaeological investigations conducted by the Kalispel Natural Resources Department, Cultural Resources Program over the course of 10 years, I analyze bighorn sheep protein residues from identified on artifacts from 75% of sampled sites (N=12) along the Pend Oreille River as a zooarchaeological study. The antiquity of this pattern (1500 to 200 years before present [BP]) indicates that this was not a mere fluke of recovery, but rather a pattern of subsistence and a normal component of family provisioning. To explain these findings, I developed archaeological expectations based on a logistical model of bighorn sheep procurement and processing. In conclusion, I discuss solutions as to what this could mean for future conservation efforts for the bighorn sheep on Hall Mountain, uncover potential biases, and future avenues of research."

Pressure, a culturally-specific illness, has become an increasing concern for villagers who live on Dominica’s eastern coast. No prior specific studies on this illness have been performed. Thus, this study provides insight into an illness of local concern that may have relevance throughout the Caribbean. Additionally, this thesis includes an analysis of the traditional preparation of the second most salient treatment for pressure, papaya. This is one of few studies that specifically examines the traditional preparation of a plant medicine. 
Aim of Study 
This thesis examines Dominican notions of pressure, a cultural syndrome with correlations to anxiety and hypertension. I outline perceptions of pressure’s etiology, symptoms, 
and treatments, focusing on the stressors that rural Dominicans consider most pressing.  
Materials and Methods 
The data from this study was obtained via participant-observation, key consultant interviews, and freelisting interviews, all of which took place in a remote, Dominican village. 
Demographic data and freelist results were further examined with salience calculations and general linear modeling. Additionally, I prepared a Dominican papaya decoction using 
methodology as described by Bwa Mawegans and analyzed the resultant samples with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). 
Results 
Pressure is a common, culturally-specific syndrome characterized by a headache, dizziness, giddiness, neck stiffness, and malaise. Its causes include anxiety, poor diet, fright, and high susceptibility and frequency of temper disruptions. Depending on its cause, the illness can build up over time or onset suddenly. Either way, locals believe that the illness relates to the thickening of blood. Treatments for pressure include local bush medicines, improving lifestyle, and improving dietary choices. The LC/MS results found methyl palmitate, stigmasterol, serine, valine, glycine, and tyrosine across papaya samples. The traditional papaya preparation contained the benefits of the seeds and endocarp, comprising a well-balanced medication. 
Conclusions 
Through examining pressure, an illness with corollaries to diet-related noncommunicable diseases and mental health, I was able to demonstrate the primary consequences 
of urbanization and modernization for a rural Dominican community. Currently, Bwa Mawegans are increasingly concerned with political corruption, climate change, domestic abuse, and poor social support. Further, this thesis demonstrated the importance of studying ethnomedicines within their cultural context by conducting mass spectrometry studies on the traditional preparations of plants."

Utilizing counterstory to center discussions of race, particularly as they concern AAPI, I call greater attention to the traumatic racial experiences that accompany such identities. In undertaking this work, I advance three main claims. First, I argue for the necessity of interrogating race outside the black and white binary that dominates writing center scholarship; second, I contend that the model minority myth and foreigner racialization play out in writing center spaces in unique ways that warrant attention; finally, I suggest that counterstories can be used as anti-oppressive tools in writing centers to centralize discussions of race and challenge monolingual “standards” of English.

By reconstructing the diet and health profiles of 45 juveniles from five prehistoric Bay Area sites [CA-SCL-134, Yakmuy ‘Ooyákma-tka (CA-SCL-215), CA-ALA-329, CA-SCL-623, and CA-SCL-870], individual diets were studied, as well as patterns observed in life history milestones relating to diet (e.g. weaning age and age at which children begin independent foraging). Results suggest that weaning behavior varied over time, based on a decrease in the mean age of the start of weaning during the Late Period. This sample also shows a faster tempo of weaning compared with studies of contemporaneously occupied Bay Area sites. Dietary reconstructions of weaned children indicate that independent foraging by children is typical childhood behavior, and self-provisioning is connected to learning hunting and foraging skills. As the child ages and skills improve, the resources they procure and consume change and eventually match those of adult diets. Finally, results show a higher prevalence of skeletal stress indicators among children with lower protein diets. This study contributes to important anthropological discussions regarding the facultative nature of childhood and life histories and identifies possible influential factors to these dynamics."

The first manuscript contains a narrative review on studies relating to Native American veteran Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. It also provides an in-depth look at Native American demographics and historical trauma theory. It also identifies several key limitations of previously conducted studies (lack of studies, limited sample size and the lack of pan-tribal data). The second manuscript describes a study addressing these limitations, which describes Native American veterans’ perceived barriers and facilitators for seeking treatment for PTSD as they relate to identification with one’s own Native cultural identity and an exploration of weather differences exist between gender across these variables. The participants include 717 self-identified Native American veterans, consisting of over 200 tribal affiliations, and representing all branches of the United States Military. This study utilizes rs  values to show direction of monotonic relationships and rs2 values to show the coefficient of determination. Results indicate positive monotonic relationships exist between one’s level of identification with Native culture and several of the barriers and facilitators identified, as well as significant differences by gender."

However, substance use trends differ by region and there is immense diversity amongst Tribes. In addition, many AI/AN youth are from multicultural heritages, a group typically ignored by research. This study used data from tenth grade respondents to the Washington Healthy Youth Survey from 2006-2018 to explore marijuana use prevalence rates amongst AI/AN-only and multicultural AI/AN youth in Washington state and the risk and protective factors influencing their substance use. Statistical analyses revealed both AI/AN-only and multicultural AI/AN HYS respondents had significantly higher marijuana use prevalence rates than their non-Native peers. Both groups of AI/AN youth also initiated marijuana use at younger ages than their non-Native peers. In addition, AI/AN-only and multicultural AI/AN tenth graders reported significantly higher mean scores on risk factor scales and lower mean scores on protective factor scales than non-Native youth. However, many of the risk and protective factors associated with marijuana use for non-Native youth were not significantly predictive of marijuana use for AI/AN-only youth, nor, to a lesser extent, multicultural AI/AN youth. This study's findings suggest that research needs to be inclusive of multicultural AI/AN health, a substantial segment of the AI/AN population that is at high risk and generally overlooked. In addition, both AI/AN-only and multicultural AI/AN youth have unique risk and protective factors from the general population which may better explain marijuana use patterns. Prevention programs must address these unique needs if they are to effectively serve AI/AN populations."

I develop a low-frequency (multi-decadal to millennial-scale) temperature reconstruction for the southwestern United States (SWUS) for the last 5,000 years, where temperature was modulated by ENSO phase and intensity. Further, I show how this temperature record, and an ENSO record that can be inferred from it, affected the rate of uptake and intensity of maize farming. Depending on the phase, ENSO contributes to cooler-wetter conditions (El Niño) or warmer-drier conditions (La Niña). Maize was domesticated in Mexico and arrives in southern Arizona around 3600 BC—a few thousand years prior to the NDT. However, maize does not move quickly north from Arizona, but rather arrives in New Mexico around 2300 BC. Temperature, ENSO, and adaptational constraints affected the rate at which maize moved north. Maize dependence increases substantially in southeastern Utah during Basketmaker II (500 BC – AD 500). The slow movement north from the southern SWUS is due to latitudinal constraints. Maize was under selective pressure to reduce time to flowering under the novel day-length and cooler temperature regimes encountered as it moved north and often up in elevation. The ability to grow maize in cooler conditions expanded where people could live and farm, contributing to major increases in population sizes and densities (the NDT). As a result, people navigated an increasingly complicated landscape in new ways. Tattooing was one way that people showed group affiliation, helping to negotiate relationships between individuals during the NDT. The temperature and ENSO reconstruction suggest that conditions were favorable for maize production and population expansion during the first millennium AD, when El Niño-like conditions prevailed, but turned less favorable in the second millennium AD under the influence of La Niña-like conditions, contributing to the demise of the Chacoan regional system and depopulation of the northern Southwest. I bring together a variety of methods and information through computational and reproducible approaches and a suite of other tools to better understand coupled human and natural systems.

Artifact function can be determined through experimental archaeology, use-wear, and paleoethnobotanical analyses. Determining artifact function provides information about the types of tasks people performed, including activities involving materials which are unlikely to preserve in the archaeological record. Such data are valuable for our understanding of day-to-day activities and larger scale past economic organization. This thesis addresses the function a novel form of unifacial scraper from the Classic period (250 – 900 AD) Maya city of Waka’, Guatemala. I employed experimental replication, use-wear analysis, and paleoethnobotanical analyses to ascertain potential functions for the specific tool type. This study shows that these tools were likely intended to process soft organic materials such as maguey cacti, but in practice they were employed for a variety of tasks. Beyond investigating the function of a novel tool form, produced on chert, which is underappreciated in Maya archaeology, this thesis uses this information to comment on the nature of Classic period Maya economies. This research adds to broader ongoing reassessments of Maya economies, which are now recognized as more similar to our own economies than previously thought. I find that these scrapers were quotidian tools manufactured by specialists and exchanged through a commercial system, illustrating that Classic Maya economies were complex, multi-scalar, and commercialized."

I examine interdisciplinary texts that include U.S.-centered literature, documentaries, activist discourses, medical journal articles, and environmental discourses. Through these texts, I demand greater attention to environmental factors as social determinants of health and how communities deemed disposable are disproportionately affected by health inequities. My dissertation utilizes frameworks borrowed from medical humanities, environmental humanities, critical race theory, gender theory, and disability politics, particularly slow violence, debility, and reproductive justice, to address the failures of a conservative medical humanities culture that ignores social injustices. Drawing upon women of color writing, including Audre Lorde’s The Cancer Journals, Cherríe Moraga’s Heroes and Saints, and Toni Morrison’s Home, I theorize how their literary texts function as aesthetic blueprints of lived realities that are ignored in medical training. These aesthetic blueprints act as counter-narratives that re-present communities otherwise rendered disposable as active in coalitions, advocacy, and resistance. By examining these contemporary U.S.-centered texts alongside social movements, I elicit the participation of women of color writers and social movements in diagnosing social determinants of health. I also explore the role of these social movements in transforming medical treatment and the capitalist U.S. healthcare system.The chapters delve into specific case studies of health equity issues in conjunction with health and environmental justice activism. Analyzing the disparities and organizing surrounding breast cancer, pesticide-related illnesses, and forced sterilization, I emphasize the existence of and continued need for collective approaches to health injustices. The liberatory efforts of Black Lives Matter, White Coats for Black Lives, the Black Panther Party, the United Farm Workers, and SisterSong: Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective are centered in my dissertation. Collectively, these case studies support my argument that social liberation movements, and their connections to health and environmental activism, are also social determinants of health. This research joins the published critiques raised against medical education for ignoring oppressive systems and social justice by arguing that medical education should include attention to the historical roles of social movements in shaping medical discourse and practices in the United States."

The relationships between the heartlands of the North American Southwest and many of its resulting frontiers have been explored; however, very little work has been done to characterize this dynamic in the far “northern periphery,” the Fremont region. Despite over a hundred years of research and a material culture with distinct Southwest origins, it is still not clear how interaction between Fremont and the greater Southwest influenced and shaped identity and culture on this northern frontier. Extreme changes occurred in the Fremont region around A.D. 1000 when painted ceramics, along a suite of Southwestern-looking material and behavioral traits accompanied a significant population increase in the Fremont region. This dissertation uses a multi-scalar approach to explore this why these changes occurred at this critical juncture and how they impacted Fremont social identity.  
	This project explores the production, distribution, and use of Fremont painted pottery at three scales to better articulate Fremont within their broader regional context and create a more robust understanding of what ‘Fremont’ means. The results of this multi-scalar analysis suggest that Fremont painted designs are closely related to the design horizons produced in the Northern San Juan and Cibola/Chaco regions during the A.D. 900s and early 1000s, possibly arriving in the region via migration. These designs were adapted to create a distinctive Fremont design style that remained relatively static for nearly 300 years. Painted pottery was primarily produced in two areas but was widely distributed across the Fremont region. Peoples across the region used painted pottery in similar contexts, most commonly associated with integrative communal structures.  
	When these results are situated within the social, demographic, and historical context of the northern Southwest, they suggest that during the Late Fremont Period, the Fremont region became a dynamic frontier of the northern Southwest where people maintained a shared social identity. The designs painted on Fremont pottery signal both a heritage in and separation from the greater Southwest."

Kin alloparents, such as grandmothers, have been widely studied. Fewer studies have looked at the potential impact that non-kin alloparents have on child outcomes. Interbirth intervals and child mortality rates are commonly used to determine alloparents’ impact on children, however there are other potential measures that could be used, such as education. Education often leads to better individual outcomes, such as increased access to economic, social, and symbolic capital that can translate into greater success in marriage markets and better access to resources. We look at two horticultural communities in Bolivia where the ritual kinship system compadrazgo, or godparent relationship, is common. We examine data collected through surveys (n = 616) using Bayesian mixed-effect models to determine whether these ritual kin provide alloparental care for their godchildren that translates into measurable increases in educational attainment. We find that in the context of the sampled communities, godparents do not have an effect on educational attainment. This may be a product of how the data were collected; we make recommendations for how field researchers can better assess the impact of non-kin alloparents in future research."

It was the only mission founded in California under the Mexican flag, and it was the only mission founded during that period without the permission of the Catholic Church but with the direct support of the governor. The Mission's late founding in 1823 and its distance from Mexico significantly influenced its development and provided the ideal environment for extreme forms of abuse both before and after secularization. The Sonoma Mission acts as a case study for exploring the political founding of the mission, as well as providing glimpses of how indigenous inhabitants reacted to the abuse, and their struggles to survive secularization under military and civil authoritative control, 1823-1846. This thesis is a borderlands microhistory that includes global linkages and a brief historical background of pre-contact cultures, the region, the influence of gift giving, the formation of new alliances as well as the mission program itself. The narrative begins with the unethical founding of the Mission and continues through post-secularization, formally ending with the Bear Flag Rebellion in 1846. This comprehensive examination includes the previously undocumented 1824 revolt, aspects of punishment, and the realities of everyday life at the Sonoma Mission. By investigating personal interactions and relationships between native and non-native actors, this work provides glimpses of how Native Americans coped with the changing political, economic, and sociocultural landscapes, as well as offering a window into the ecological devastation that arose as outsiders inundated the region. The writings of non-native authors, official documents, and oral interviews of survivors illuminate scenes of traditional lifestyles. These include snapshots of religious blending and the continuance of indigenous customs, such as wife stealing, marriage practices, war attire, and tattooing. There can be little doubt that coping with the conquest was problematic at best, especially in the borderlands where missionaries, Indians, Russian traders, Spaniards/Mexicans, and an array of others were jockeying for power, place, and space. This is clearly apparent in the lives of a few of the actors in the 1850s following California's statehood."

In 1846, Spalding acquired Nez Perce clothing, artifacts, and horse gear which he shipped to his friend and supporter, Dr. Dudley Allen, in Ohio. In exchange for these Native American goods, Dr. Allen, a benefactor to the Presbyterian mission sent needed commodities to Spalding. After Allen’s death, his son, Dudley, donated the Spalding-Allen Collection to Oberlin College in 1893. Oberlin College in turn loaned most, but not all, of the collection to the Ohio Historical Society (OHS) for safe keeping where it languished for decades. 
In 1976, curators at Nez Perce National Historic Park (NEPE) rediscovered the collection. After negotiations, OHS loaned most of the Spalding-Allen artifacts to the National Park Service in 1980 on renewable one-year loans. However, in 1993 OHS abruptly demanded the return of the collection. In negotiations with OHS, the National Park Service learned that OHS would sell the collection, but only at its full appraised value of $608,100 with a six-month deadline to provide the money. The Nez Perce Tribe raised the money within six months with help from thousands of donors and purchased the collection where it is now on loan to NPS. 
This project explores the attempted dispossession of Nez Perce cultural heritage. In his barter of Nez Perce goods, Spalding sought to end traditional Nez Perce culture, by advocating that the Nez Perce adopt western dress, agriculture, and a stern version of Christianity. Ironically, at the same time Spalding worked to “civilize” the Nez Perce, he also created an archive of their earliest documented material culture.  The ethics of acquiring, bartering, owning, and selling Native cultural history will be explored. This research is important for it demonstrates that collections are never impartial or neutral, instead archives reflect the interests of their creators resulting in a complex, and often problematic, historical record. The origins of collections—their provenance—is critical for the future ethical curation of indigenous collections held in museums and archives."

When Oregon settlers established a provisional government in 1841, they in one sense officially founded a settler colony. Initially, its settlers recreated and enforced laws drawn from both the American and British empires. After the Oregon Treaty in 1846, however, the region south of the 49th parallel, west of the Rocky Mountains, and north of California became a colonial outpost solely of the United States. Although influenced by legislation from U.S., including from other emerging states of the West, Oregon's laws took on nuanced emphases and new articulations when legislators there excluded specific groups from natural and political rights. With each step in the process toward statehood, Oregon reinforced the validity of its laws, even when those laws contradicted the U.S. Constitution or precedents established by legislators in other states and territories. 
The transformation of Oregon and its relationship with the United States demonstrate how the construction of these Oregon laws, and the arguments surrounding their construction, reified and institutionalized legal definitions and national perceptions of race, gender, and citizenship in the United States on the eve of the Civil War. Oregon's exclusionary laws either served as a supportive continuation of racial and gender restriction to specific rights, or established a legal precedent for such restrictions, evidenced in the development of legislation throughout the remainder of the century. Additionally, Oregon's experience provides an American example of settler colonialism and demonstrates how a settler colony can impact an empire."

It argues that the Wanapum made a decisive break in the mid-twentieth century from the admonition of their nineteenth-century leader Smohalla, who had encouraged them to reject interactions with the outside white community. The Wanapum's later leaders, however, saw the need to form key, strategic relationships with outsiders during critical times when external forces threatened their rights, land, and culture. These decisions to make alliances were a main factor in enabling their persistence during the threats to their fishing rights, the removal from traditional lands due to the construction of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, and the loss of important cultural sites with the building of the Priest Rapids and Wanapum Dams. The strategic alliances that they fostered when faced with these critical threats in the mid-century benefitted their community and aided in their cultural persistence. This thesis first examines the threat to the Wanapum's fishing rights in the late 1930s, when the Wanapum's leader, Puck Hyah Toot (Johnny Buck), joined Lucullus Virgil McWhorter to advocate to the public and the Senate of Washington for Wanapum fishing rights. This chapter also details the idea of the Wanapum as ""authentic Indians,"" and argues this was a key reason why many whites were willing to help the Wanapum with their fishing rights at this time. Chapter Two shows how the relationship between Johnny Buck and Colonial Franklin T. Matthias in the early 1940s allowed the Wanapum unique access to traditional fishing sites during the creation of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, and also details the importance of the land to the Wanapum. Chapter Three demonstrates how Johnny Buck's relationship with Click Relander in the 1950s, and subsequently the Grant County PUD, allowed the Wanapum to gain some concessions from the construction of the dams and the resulting loss of important cultural sites. With these strategic relationships, the Wanapum were able to maintain their tribal identity and secure their interests into the twenty-first century"

Over the next several years the Whitman massacre came to play a central role in Americans' understanding of and identity with the frontier experience. At the hands of late nineteenth-century romantics, Marcus and Narcissa bore the burden of martyred sainthood while early twentieth-century novelists depicted them as the quintessential pioneer family, as trailblazers with patriotic and nationalistic intentions, and as civilizers of the wild Pacific Northwest. While Narcissa has been the subject of some gender analysis, no comparable studies exist which seriously investigate the role of masculinity in the creation, perpetuation, and diffusion of the Whitman memory. Thus, this project addresses how an emphasis on Marcus Whitman's masculinity played a central role in the popularity and persistence of the Whitman memory in fostering an American manhood. The Whitman massacre legacy retains its importance in the twenty-first century because for more than one hundred fifty years it has been used to justify and reaffirm white Americans' entitlement to the U.S. West. In turning a critical eye towards the ways in which American  vii storytellers have memorialized Marcus in rigidly gendered terms, not only is the interdependence of masculinity and civility in American culture brought into focus, but it also brings a forgotten dimension back to an account that has been flattened over time. By questioning how Marcus Whitman was depicted as a civilized Victorian gentleman who personified true religion, patriotism, married life, and frontier capability, the important way that the Whitman narrative has been manipulated through language and imagery is exposed. This study of manipulation reveals that it is through gendered romanticism that the local and regional memory of Whitman became part of an American national memory bound in the transformative power of the frontier experience."

The origin myth functions rhetorically by presenting a simplification of a tumultuous history. In Mexico, for example, this simplification is that the nation is born out of a great indigenous legacy and an anticolonial struggle. The problem with this myth is that it hides the coloniality that remained after New Spain became Mexico. The myth of the nation is reproduced within culturally significant stories that function as metonymies of the nation's ideological values. For Mexico, the ideological presents itself in the stories of la Virgen de Guadalupe; Malintzin, the indigenous translator who helped Hernán Cortés; and la Llorona, the crying spirit who drowned her children in a fit of rage. These three are metonymic tropes and they function to craft a narrative about the nation that fits with the origin myth."

In Chapter 2, I read Mary Hallock Foote's first novel, The Led-Horse Claim: A Romance of a Mining Camp (1883) alongside maps that advertise the claims of Leadville, Colorado, and argue that the fiction undermines the cartographic narrative of a transparent, profitable mining industry. Rather than perpetuate the myth that fortunes are easy to find, Foote links mapping and boundaries to violence. Next, I argue that Helen Hunt Jackson's novel Ramona (1884) gains new significance in light of her concern with the mapping and surveying of Indian reservations, evident in her other writings. Ramona came out the same year that the Office of Indian Affairs published the Map of Indian Reservations within the Limits of the United States. The second iteration of the map, published five years later, includes an inset of the Mission region not included in the original, a modification that is a testament to the influence of her work. Finally, I read Mourning Dove's Cogewea, the Half-Blood: A Depiction of the Great Montana Range (1927) as a counter to the rationalized versions of the Flathead Indian Reservation depicted in maps marketing the opening of the reservation for non-Indigenous settlement with a highly romanticized version of the landscape. The novel contests the cartographic erasure of the indigenous population by describing the landscape from the perspective of an indigenous woman. The pairing of maps with specific examples of regional literature offers new insights regarding regionalism's simultaneous critique and solidification of mainstream culture, allowing us to rethink the power of regionalism in cartographic terms."

I have named this reflection of land within language, earthly rhetorics. The perspective that I offer discusses the way in which Nez Perce rhetorics exist as a whole and are not separated into the secular and the sacred, but rather are used as one wholly rhetoric. In chapter 1, ""Earth and Language,"" I discuss how earthly rhetorics were born when Nez Perce people went through the transition from their tribal language to English. In chapter 2, ""Rhetorics of Powwow,"" I explore the rhetorics spoken by the powwow emcee and the rhetoric of the regalia worn by powwow dancers. Chapter 3, ""Virtual Rhetorics,"" analyzes online rhetorics of prisoners as appearing in three Native American prisoner pen pal websites. And chapter 4, ""Wholly Rhetorics,"" considers how secular ceremonial rhetorics that occur during powwows and as found on one tribal member’s Facebook postings are the same set of rhetorics used during private sacred ceremonies that only tribal members attend, concluding that the sacred and the secular are the same set of rhetorics."

By conflating images of the trickster as described by NDN scholars with the postmodern theories of Donna Haraway, I explore in my dissertation how the trickster provides a way of viewing formerly accepted boundaries of identity from new perspectives. As cyborg, the trickster is in the ""system,"" but it is also enacting change by pushing against those boundaries, exposing them as social fictions. I create a cyborg trickster heuristic, using it as a lens with which to both analyze how NDNs construct online identities and the rhetorical maneuvers they undergo. Moving beyond access issues, I show how NDNs are strengthening their presence through social media. Ultimately, I argue that the cyborg trickster shows how identities (NDN and non-NDN alike) are multiply-created and constantly in flux, transcending the traditional boundaries of self and other, online and offline, space and place, to allow for a new understanding of the individual in society and society within the individual."

Grounded in the theoretical frameworks of Tribal Critical Race Theory and Indigenous Knowledge Systems, this inquiry utilizes Indigenous Research Methodologies for the collection and analysis of qualitative interviews. Key themes that emerged from the stories and teachings of the elders in this inquiry include the importance of: ancestral knowledge (culture), tribal sovereignty (language), community (trust and respect), and teaching and learning (education and curriculum).  Additionally, the author’s own positionality and epistemology as a Dine and Nimiipuu scholar are discussed in relation to the significance of decolonizing Western education through ancestral knowledge and culturally responsive curriculum."

To examine these practices, burial treatments such as the inclusion of grave goods and positioning for each burial was recorded, and this data was examined to illuminate its structure using Fisher's Exact tests and a Correspondence Analysis. This thesis explores burial treatments through time to better understand Coast Salish society and death ritual. It is expected that status, age, gender and other social practices impact one another in ways that have not been accounted for in prior studies, and that these social expressions are more complex than has been posited. The first element of this study considers Coast Salish burials through a series of bivariate analyses focusing on time, age and sex. It is assumed that beginning with the Marpole period (ca 2500 years BP) that ascribed status systems were present, which should appear in the burial record as both young and old individuals having elaborate grave goods and treatments. Although there are instances of child burials with some representations of wealth, overall child burials are  v unadorned in comparison to adult burials. Additionally, certain burial aspects such as land hunting instruments or decorative goods appear gendered. These results indicate that status and gender were both more complex social practices than has been previously recognized. The second element of this study considers the collected burial attributes together in a single multivariate analysis. In this statistical approach, it appears that the bivariate relationships hold true, and that the interplay of gender, status and other social norms structured Coast Salish burial practices throughout the last four millennia."

According to CT models, restricted access to technical knowledge should result in decreased stylistic and fine-scale metric variation through time in craft traditions. The presence of such a reduction in variation in formal stone tool technologies over time serves as evidence of a shift in learning practices having occurred in concert with the emergence of hereditary inequality. 
High resolution analyses of formed lithic tools from previously excavated archaeological 
collections was conducted to examine fine scale stylistic and metric variation in assemblages in sites throughout the Salish Sea. In addition, I also examined the impacts of additional factors on variation often not considered in CT research such as material quality, tool curation, and time averaging effects which did not appear to be factors significantly patterning this sample. The timing of the introduction of new technologies such as hafted ground stone tools and the bow and arrow, and their potential impacts on learning and variation were also assessed, and the gradual adoption of that technology did not appear to have a major impact on stylistic or metric variation. 
Stylistic variation in hafted chipped and ground stone tools was found to increasingly 
depart from the expectations of neutral cultural variation through time. The number of new styles introduced was also found to crash during the Marpole period. Combined with spatial heterogeneity in assemblage richness and evenness, it appears that lithic craft knowledge became increasingly restricted through time and space. However, metric variation did not exhibit any strong chronological trends. Tool blade elements had significantly higher variation in metric attributes than haft elements. Haft metric variation was consistently low through time when considering the poor material quality of used toolstone. Overall these data suggest that the learning of these technologies may have been restricted by gender and kin lines, and became increasingly influenced by prestige over the past 5,000 years."

While the intensive exploitation of salmon and other marine resources was a critical element of Northwest Coast economies for millennia, I argue that plants were also intensified and actively managed, but in a different way than marine resources. This dissertation investigates resource production by considering investment in terrestrial landscapes and floral resources by the precontact Coast Salish of the Gulf of Georgia during the last 5,000 years. I argue that understanding changes in human-environmental interactions and how terrestrial landscapes were constructed and managed is crucial to the discussion of how and when social complexity was established in the region. 
The coastal island environments of the southwestern British Columbia contain spatially and temporally constrained resources that can easily be overexploited during times of increased human population. Through terrestrial land management practices precontact Coast Salish peoples were able to adequately control and maintain plant resource patches without overexploitation. In the Pacific Northwest, anthropogenic fire was one tool used to enhance resource production and bolster the productivity of terrestrial landscapes. In applying fire, the structure of vegetation communities and terrestrial landscapes were altered and became more ""humanized"". Increased investment in landscape maintenance through anthropogenic burning is apparent at the Shingle Point archaeological site (DgRv-002) on Valdes Island over the last 4,500 years. Charcoal counts and morphologies derived from 1 cm samples of sediment cores from two separate locations on Valdes Island establish important differences between human and natural fire signals during the last five millennia. The methodology I have developed here focuses on both morphology and total charcoal counts and provides a means to address problems with discriminating human-set from naturally ignited fire events in the Pacific Northwest."

What local strategies and responses to nutritional trauma lead to positive health outcomes? This research will help identify the positive responses and strategies to nutritional trauma within the community to build upon and find community solutions to address the lingering health problems caused by nutritional trauma.  Nutritional trauma involves the disruption of access to indigenous natural foods and medicines as a result of imposed and overwhelming external forces including development, introduction of agriculture, deforestation, environmental destruction, contamination by toxic wastes, pesticides and herbicides, and the imposition of land tenure laws that to a great extent exclude native ownership (Korn and Ryser 2005).  Nutritional trauma is a subset of community trauma and historical trauma. “The historical experience of culture groups exposed to prolonged stress and suffering resulting from war, genocide, interpersonal violence triggers the ‘transfer’ of physiological, biological, and emotional stress to successive generations” (Korn and Ryser 2009). 
The data consisted of 40 interviews collected between September and December 2018.  Correlation tables and logistic models (full model and step-wise model) were used to understand the data. The findings indicated 1.) there were no significant associations between the access variables and nutritional illness, 2.) growing up on the reservation was negatively correlated with reporting a nutritional illness, 3.) fitness was significantly associated with reporting a nutritional illness and 4.) having a family member that suffered from a nutrition related illness increased the likelihood of an participant reporting a nutritional illness. Today, the Chehalis tribe is actively working to repair the trauma to heal the soul wound. The reservations which once pained Native Americans can be transformed into sources of power and resilience today. Tribal members demonstrated resiliency in a number of ways including: participating in cultural events, learning and utilizing traditional ecological knowledge, using humor to connect and cope, knowledge and use of community resources, having a strong social network of friends and family, as well as, other personal practices, motivations, and desires to engage in healthier lifestyle practices."

This thesis presents indigenous archaeology as an approach that enriches archaeological practice, while addressing root grievances at the heart of contentious relationships between the colonial nation state and indigenous peoples. Indigenous archaeology provides contexts in which archaeologists can transform their practice and marshal archaeological research in service of descendant communities, as the peoples for whom this research is most relevant and has the greatest impacts. In this thesis, I present research conducted at the Dionisio Point locality (DgRv003 and DgRv-006) on Galiano Island, southwestern British Columbia, Canada as an indigenous-focused, collaborative effort between the Penelakut and other Hul'qumi'num First Nations, Washington State University archaeologists, BC Parks, and the local Galiano community. This project brought together several actors and interests to salvage  v and protect an important archaeological site on Hul'qumi'num ancestral land. We, the collaborators, developed a methodology consistent with Hul'qumi'num traditions of cultural heritage management as expressed in Hul'qumi'num customary law. I present the basic tenets of Hul'qumi'num customary law that pertain to archaeological research and illustrate how these tenets were incorporated and implemented in archaeological practice in the 2012 excavation of the Parry Lagoon midden site DgRv-006 at Dionisio Point. I place these efforts within broader contexts, demonstrating not only the archaeological, but also the historical, political, and environmental significance of this research. Through a contextualization of this case study, I demonstrate how archaeological evidence can be marshaled in support of modern indigenous struggles for political self-determination within ancestral territories, combat culture loss as a consequence of colonization, and bolster indigenous efforts toward cultural persistence and revival. While these efforts must be grounded in local context and practice, indigenous struggles for sovereignty are a global phenomenon that questions the foundations of Western imperialism and combats the cultural and political homogenization that results from colonization. Indigenous archaeology is but one path towards a more plural and rich future, in which our research achieves positive outcomes for many actors.

As many societies from this region, they share an important number of sociocultural practices with their neighbors. One of their most distinctive features is their social organization, characterized by a moiety division. The Tlingit possess a distinct matrilineal exogamous system in which marriage takes place among clans from two opposite moieties: the Raven and Eagle clans. Tlingit oral accounts contain relevant information about the origins and history of these social groups. Previous studies have shown a strong correlation between maternal clan membership and genetic variation. In this study, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from modern Tlingit (n=154) are examined. By comparing mtDNA with moiety membership information, I explore the impact of marriage traditions among the Tlingit on their observable genetic variation. The results support the idea that even after the European colonization, it is still possible to recognize maternal moiety identity on a genetic level. This thesis also illustrates the relevance of data derived from Tlingit oral traditions to test hypotheses about population history on the Northwest Coast."

This is evinced by the presence of stone pipes and pipe fragments in sites across the region--in particular, along the Columbia and Fraser River systems. This thesis summarizes the spatial and chronological distribution of archaeological smoking pipes throughout the inland Pacific Northwest based on literature and database searches, with a particular focus on those collections held or formerly held by the Washington State University Museum of Anthropology. In addition, the results of chemical residue analyses considering the material smoked in a number of pipes and pipe fragments from sites spanning the region will be reviewed. The results of the residue testing of twelve previously unanalyzed pipes is also presented. A significant finding from these new analyses is the identification of nicotine, a biomarker of tobacco species (Nicotiana spp.), in a single complete pipe from a site in Grant County, Washington. Associated with a radiocarbon date of 1334 - 1524 cal BP, this is the northernmost evidence and earliest radiocarbon dated evidence of tobacco use in the Pacific Northwest. The metabolomic analysis of the compounds extracted from various archaeological pipes suggests a previously unknown antiquity for the cultivation and use of Nicotiana quadrivalvis, a tobacco species whose natural range does not extend to the region studied. This study is part of a larger research program developed in collaboration with indigenous communities in the United States and Canada, and sheds light on the practice of smoking as well as the traditional use and management of smoke plants throughout the Pacific Northwest."

Utilizing a self-reflexive methodology, this work makes interventions in Native American and indigenous studies, comparative genocide studies, historiography, and geography to argue for more expansive languages with which to grapple with Native experiences of genocide. In so doing, this paper also asserts the need for indigenous narrative self-determination, development of decolonial epistemologies and praxes on genocide, and languages for violence that are specifically designed to facilitate dialogue on healing. For that reason, this work not only positions cartography and maps as a particularly useful language for understanding indigenous experiences of genocide, but documents the development of this language, with the intent of supporting and guiding others in creating alternative languages that best fit their nation, community, family, and selves. Finally, the larger aim of this work is to make the case for languages on genocide that heal, rather than re-traumatize, and give a more holistic understanding of the ways in which genocide 'takes place' spatially and temporally, with the hope of creating a larger, more inclusive, less violent space for imagining and crafting restorative justice."

This thesis attempts to link these two fields via the history and cultural framing of these populations in the Pacific Northwest (including Canada). The Pacific Northwest is unique in that the histories of Americans/Canadians racially framing and discriminating against Asian North Americans and Indigenous Peoples occur roughly at the same historical moment. Both are subject to forms of racial proximity defined by their mutual and differing relationships to power and their geographic closeness to one another in the Pacific Northwest. I highlight the connections in the Northwest to the larger history of carcerality and settler colonialism in the United States and Canada. Done so via legal and juridical decisions and practices at the Federal, state/provincial, and municipal levels. I also study the cultural framing of Asian North Americans and Indigenous Peoples at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, an event highlighting the global position and power of Seattle in the early 20th Century. I turn to the novels Salt Fish Girl by Larissa Lai and Monkey Beach by Eden Robinson to consider alternative epistemologies available in grounding decolonization efforts in Indigenous knowledge and actions. I close this thesis by highlighting the activism of Idle No More and Standing Rock activists in building potential activist coalitions with other movements such as Black Lives Matter and then how might Asian Americans fit into this recent wave of activism. Through these steps, I demonstrate the potential connections between Asian American Studies and Indigenous Studies, how these particular histories share an important piece in the history of carcerality in the United States and Canada, and how alternative epistemologies offer potential tools to current activists and scholars working in these confluences."

Indigenous/Indigenist theory/methodology, the medicine wheel, and cultural safety form the framework within which the researcher heard, recorded, and analyzed participants’ personal narrative, oral history, and storytelling (Doutrich, Arcus, Dekker, Spuck, & Pollock-Robinson, 2012; Flemmer, Doutrich, Dekker, & Rondeau, 2012; Hodge, Maliski, Cadogan, Itty, & Cardoza, 2010; Nash, 2014; Nash & Viray, 2014; Kovach, 2010; Struthers & Peden-McAlpine, 2005; Wilson, 2008).  Parent participants had the opportunity to review the interview transcript for completeness and accuracy three times. Recommendations for nursing were recorded and presented back to both the parents and the Elders Circle for their review and approval."

Engaging in close collaboration with indigenous peoples from two societies in the Latin American tropics, and responding to national, regional and international legal and ethical guidelines, the aim of this study is twofold: (1) to propose a structured approach to first, engage with indigenous communities in formats locally relevant and accepted (i.e. following traditional and customary procedures and norms) while also ethically appropriate (i.e. following relevant codes of ethics and policy). (2) to engage in truly collaborative academic research, implementing a cross-paradigm process combining components of the collaborative ethnography and indigenous epistemologies. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of these proposed procedures this study implements two ethnobiological researches, the first one on the effects of firearms introduction to the traditional hunting and fishing practices of the Tsimane’ in Bolivia, and the second one on the importance of plants and associated knowledge (ethnobotany) in the process of fabrication and use of traditional bows and arrows. This second study has two components, a traditional ethnographic documentation of the information, and the production of a collaborative ethnographic film as a visual documentation and part of an applied representation of the results. All results (academic and applied) mutually complement and support one another, thus providing a holistic and more complete set of results. This study demonstrates that following ethical standards combined with local and customary regulations along with true collaboration, ethnobiological research can be a novel and innovative way to conduct research that benefits everyone involved producing locally relevant and academically significant results."

They developed their own “model” of country marriage that evolved into a horizontal “clan” system stretching across the continent. Scots “married-in” to Native communities and encouraged other employees, including the French Canadians and Hawaiian kanaka laborers and their own Scots-Indian sons to do likewise. They married their daughters to newcomers, thereby bringing them into the network as well. This pattern can be identified by researching fur trade genealogies. Over time dowries replaced bride prices and marriage became a formal affair, written contract, before a justice of the peace or in a church rather than an oral agreement. 
European fathers began to employ ideological institutions like schools and church which taught their daughter to act according to social standards such as the “Cult of Domesticity.” Native women had had a long history of adapting European trade goods into Native fashion and altering their traditional clothing styles to accommodate new lifeways, but now the daughters were expected to dress according to their European social status. The daughters of the country were now seen as assimilated and to have “married-out” of their Indian cultures and into the Euro American culture. In order to move Indian lands into the trade network and thereby the public sphere these mixed-blood women were considered assimilated and these European-Indian marriages were deemed legal and binding 
Americans traveled across the North American continent expecting to find an empty wilderness in which to plant their own version of the Puritans “city on the hill.” They took with them ideologies about the frontier, wilderness, and Indians, especially the “Indian Princess.” Captivity narratives had been used by the Puritans to establish social conformity and their morality code continued to permeate American lives 200 years later as thousands left the United States for the Pacific Northwest. Rather than a barren wilderness they found an already established agricultural community operated by the London based Hudson’s Bay Company. This “imagined community” had schools, churches, a cemetery, a lumber mill, produced grain and had a mill, as well as orchards, gardens, and livestock."

Using correspondence with former FALN member Oscar Lopez Rivera, this dissertation explores the cultural heritage debate that emerges as a result of Puerto Rican scholarship that attempts to defend and critique Puerto Ricans' ""national character."" In so doing, this dissertation draws attention to the multiple nationalisms at play. 
According to one of the first letters I received from Oscar Lopez Rivera, the ""cultural heritage,"" debate is not complex because of the myriad forms of access one has to Puerto Rican cultural and political history.  That access, as explored by scholars writing on Puerto Rican political organizations of the mid-twentieth century, frames how Puerto Ricans in the United States approach Puerto Rico's colonial question. Divergent subject positions on the status question--whether or not Puerto Rico is a colony of the US and whether or not statehood, or independence would be feasible options--allude to the complexity. The disparities between migrant and island-based Puerto Ricans further said complexity because of the inherent negotiations made as a result of social and political marginalization in contrast to relatively greater socio-economic stability. For both communities, the question of contribution and participation arises, resulting from racialized, gendered, classed, and sexualized marks of exclusions and silence. Using Chela Sandoval's Methodology of the Oppressed and Jose Esteban Munoz's Cruising Utopia, this dissertation argues that the complexities in the cultural and political discourse that addresses said question provide greater avenues of possibility. 
Exploring the possibilities of reconfiguring the role of discourse in assigning the value of contribution and participation, this dissertation incorporates Division Street, a novella that functions as a social commentary regarding the discursive and ideological parameters set around participation and contribution. Because the primary figures who model participation and contribution are male--both because of the discourse they produce and how others ideologically construct them--the novella's female characters function as antagonists to what leaders like Pedro Albizu Campos, Filiberto Ojeda Rios imagine as necessary to critically contribute to the anti-colonial struggle."

Indigenous women's genealogies are traced, exposing the intersections of colonization, governmentality, legal challenges, slavery, exploitative labor, militarization and resistances. This dissertation re-imagines a critical interdisciplinary dialogue between Native American Studies, Indigenous Studies, American Studies, History, Critical Legal Studies, Gender Studies, and Border Studies. In 2007, Indigenous peoples in El Calaboz Rancheria challenged the U.S. border wall along the Texas-Mexico border as a violation of human rights and constitutional law. The community's resistance to the state's will to dispossess them of ancestral lands, owned communally through aboriginal and Crown Land Grant title, inspired the investigations by Indigenous women to untangle their community's legal, social, economic and political histories in land-tenure along the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Their challenges to the state's use of sovereignty and militarization exposed how the government naturalized the border wall within the discourse of development. However, their legal investigation unburied centuries of legal disputations between Indigenous peoples and more than one sovereign. Indigenous women's analysis of the border wall excavated a longer history of sovereignty and state violence as interlocking tools to normalize dispossession. Drawing from colonial archives, genealogical records, community documents, photographs, government documents, and interviews of El Calaboz Rancheri?a, from the clans of Lipan Apaches and their kinship relationships, this dissertation recovers Indigenous perspectives and principles related to dispossession and genocide resistance against four governments, across five centuries: Spain, Mexico, Texas and the U.S. This project is both historical and critical memory recovery which challenge normative conceptions of Native American and Indigenous genocide history."

For almost three centuries, Euro-American travel narratives claimed to tell the truth about the Spanish mestizos of Santa Fe. A textual analysis of 17th, 18th, and 19th century travel literature about Santa Fe, reveals a racial project that worked to normalize white supremacy. Clearly reflected in these travel accounts is the racialized colonial thinking of first Spanish and then Euro-American white culture. The narratives involving Spain and New Spain reveal imperial attitudes about Native Americans and Mestizos, while the Euro-American narratives are almost entirely embedded with the nineteenth century's ideology of Manifest Destiny. This violent genre of literature, which contributed generations of damage to the name and social status of the Spanish mestizos it disparages, is useful only for reading against the grain. Reading against the grain, this dissertation juxtaposes Chicano/Spanish-mestizo experience, community, and culture against the hegemonic stories of the dominant culture. It interrogates and disrupts the normalization of white supremacy. Using Spanish mestizo eyewitness accounts, this dissertation speaks back to, and counters the Euro-American master narrative. Revealed through the course of this examination, is the colonizer's pattern of invoking ""civilization"" as an alibi to invade and conquer. By disrupting such narratives, a Chicano point-of-view is extracted, presenting a very different story - and a history for the twenty-first century"

As Indians, Mormons, Federal Land Agencies, and New Pioneers compete for social and physical domain, they inscribe culturally produced imagery on both natural and constructed landscape features.  Ethnographic data I collected from each cultural group supports my contention that their cultural symbols are identifiable through discursive metaphors and tangible imagery inscribed in place, the magnitude of which reveals their relative cultural dominance.  Similarly, dominant cultures minimize competitive symbolism to increase perceptions that they are the rightful and natural stewards of the land. 
Despite their low representative population, Federal Land Agencies currently dominate Bryce Canyon Country.  Thus, they have the ability to decree how others use the land and exhibit their positions within the cultural hierarchy.  Mormons dominate the region's population; yet they follow second in cultural dominance.  Urban retirees, or New Pioneers, have moved to Bryce Canyon Country in recent decades, steadily gaining the ability to inscribe their unique cultural symbols on the land.  Despite their position as the longest established inhabitants of Bryce Canyon Country, Indian landscape symbolism proved the least identifiable.  This is due to their traditionally minimal material culture, esoteric belief system, and inability to practice, promote, and perpetuate their lifeways on the land.  Though Indians were removed from the immediate landscape several generations ago, social isolation on reservations has helped them retain their cultural beliefs, traditions, and values, and remain connected to the land through metaphorical myths, traditional ceremonies, and communication with supernatural powers that organize the animate universe. 
Being the dominant power and stewards, not owners, of public lands, Federal Land Agencies are legally bound to protect the natural and cultural landscape in accordance with their respective agencies' missions.  This obligation includes protecting the rights of associated groups to maintain their cultural heritage by practicing their lifeways on the land in a sustainable manner.  With notable exceptions, Federal Land Agencies have fallen short in this regard.  Instead, they have increased their own visibility and dominance, while precluding others from engaging in land use practices that promotes cultural fitness and heterogeneity."

Deconstructive analysis of works by non-Native and Indigenous scholars illuminates settler colonialism’s historical formation and lasting legacies. Tracing Indian responses and resistance reveals an extensive history of Indigenous perseverance that traces back 600 years and continues into the present day. 
Two broad issues occupy the analysis: 1) U.S. colonial policy with its racializing legacy of “blood quanta” established during the Allotment Era in the late 1800s extends into present-day controversies surrounding eligibility requirements for tribal membership, and 2) varied colonial assaults on Indigenous cultural landscapes threaten traditional land-use treaty rights for hunting, fishing, and gathering on Indian, federal, and public lands, continuing to facilitate colonial strategies of appropriation, assimilation, and elimination that began as early as the 1600s. 
I conclude this project with a contemporary example of strategic Indigenous agency by Colorado Southern Utes against U.S. settler colonial normalization and subjugation followed by valuable insights from Pawnee attorney, activist, tribal judge, and author, Walter Echo-Hawk. Final closing remarks punctuate the imperative of educating the non-Native public to recognize and acknowledge the role of settler colonialism in major contemporary tribal issues in order to clarify misconceptions, promote understanding, facilitate intercommunications, and encourage future collaboration with Indigenous nations in U.S. society."

Semi-structured interviews were used to illuminate the nuances of the giving back concept from a Native perspective. A total of twelve participants with a bachelor s degree from four-year and graduate institutions in the Pacific Northwest and Midwest regions were interviewed. The participants in the study were selected based on the relative years they attended and graduated from college and were loosely organized into three groups: Recent Graduates, Experienced Workers, and Respected Elders. Data analysis revealed intergenerational similarities and differences among the three groups throughout their K-12 years, during college and after degree attainment. Several barriers and persistence factors were also identified. This study clearly demonstrated that the desire to give back played a critical role in the lives of the participants in this study. A key finding is that the concept of giving back is much more complex, difficult, and even painful, in the lives of Native American degree recipients upon degree completion. For every rewarding experience that giving back provided, there was also numerous struggles in the process. The process of degree attainment often resulted in strained relationships between Native American graduates and their own communities. The findings of this study are significant for two reasons. Although previous studies found that the desire to give back is a strong persistence factor for Native students in college, few studies specifically focused on the rewards and struggles associated with giving back for these students once they completed their degrees. The findings of this study clearly showed that the participants demonstrated a tremendous capacity of resiliency throughout their lives. However, the participants continued to encounter adversity when faced with the choice of how they gave back to their tribal communities after college. The participants gave back in diverse ways: some chose to ""physically"" move back home to give back while others gave back from afar. In unique ways, the same resiliency they needed while persisting toward degree completion was the same resiliency they needed to give back to the community after degree completion.

Results suggest that, on average, about twelve peer academic support sessions increase a student's course grade by approximately one full grade point, holding constant a student's academic ability and socioeconomic status.  Supplemental instruction is potentially a more effective method of peer academic support than individual peer academic support sessions and low-performing students benefit more from peer academic support than high-performing students. 
The second paper analyzes the educational impact of Native American tribal casino in Washington State. We empirically study the effect tribal casinos have on the dropout rate of schools located near tribal casinos. Next we examine the impact on the dropout rate from per capita payments. Since each federally recognized tribes is a sovereign nations, each tribe makes its own laws governing the payout of these payments. These payments are largely funded by casinos. In Washington State all tribes that make per capita payments put minor tribal member's payments in trust funds that are not technically accessible until the minor child turns 18. These trust funds are having an effect on the dropout rate of young Native American adults. 
The third paper examines the effect of the gender of the student, tutor and professor on the duration between tutoring sessions. Results suggest that the female students have a shorter duration between tutoring sessions.  The gender of the tutor or the gender of the instructor had no effect on our results however if the student and instructor were the same gender the duration between tutoring sessions shorter. This was true for both male and female students."

Improved access and achievement in higher education is important for Native American students given the connections with socio-economic power and attainment for communities in the United States in our current knowledge-based economy.  The study examines perceptions of Native American students toward online higher education in order to explore the viability of online degrees as a pathway to educational attainment.  Defined by cultural relevancy and informed by indigenous research methods and theories, the study involved three talking circles of Native American college students from higher education institutions in the Inland Northwest (Eastern Washington and North Idaho) and six tribal education administrator interviews.  Those conversations were transcribed and analyzed for common themes. 
Analysis of the findings revealed that student participants perceive online degree programs to be isolating and lacking in culturally relevant support systems.  The findings also show that many students have very limited exposure to online degree programs when evaluating colleges, and access to the necessary technology and internet connection for completing a degree online is often inadequate where they live.  These factors contribute to an overall negative perception of online higher education for the study participants"

Four theoretical frameworks consisting of identity, socialization, intersectionality, and leadership expose and contrast beliefs and values about education. Vignettes formed from life stories and interviews of family and colleagues were gathered, analyzed, and written as a dissertation to create perspective, share meaning, and encourage empathy. The presentation follows a traditional Native American storytelling format that threads together events from multiple points in time following the reflective flow of sense making. The narrative gives shape to multiple lessons: large and small, heart-felt and logical, explicit and veiled. What began as a process of searching for another way, a new beginning, is found as the path that was already being traveled, an ongoing journey. What searching yielded, however, was a renewal of strength, the commitment to cause, an enriched love for others."

Government agencies charged with carrying out federal natural resource policy built roads, dammed rivers, and drew boundary lines in the region's forests.  In August, 2013, the environmental, political, and economic implications of these actions were revealed when the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee and environmental activists protested the transport of mega-loads through the Clearwater River Valley. 
Three specific postwar federal interventions in the North Central Idaho landscape - the completion of US Highway 12, authorization and construction of Dworshak Dam, and reclassification of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness - elicited local, state, and national responses.  ""Wildly Contentious"" locates these responses, favorable and otherwise, within the related contexts of postwar consumption and consumer culture, intensified resource extraction required to fuel consumer culture and the roots of twentieth century environmentalism.

They have become the most visible community of color in higher education whose needs go almost entirely unseen. The consequence of this neglect is evident in the achievement gaps only visible in disaggregated data. But the histories and narratives that illustrate these differences are rarely used by colleges and universities to make informed decisions about this population.

Six institutions were initially identified to pilot this effort, and today 14 institutions have been designated AANAPISIs, and federal funding has been committed through 2016 to continue. This is the first federal effort to address AAPI needs in higher education. 
This case study examines the experience of one AANAPISI pilot, South Seattle Community College. I examine the experience of a college becoming an AANAPISI, and explore the strategies implemented and the outcomes realized from this effort. Because of my own role at the college, I utilize analytic autoethnography to include my own voice, experience and perspective in the case study. Critical race theory provides an effective framework to examine issues of race, seek out narratives, challenge long-held assumptions, and broaden the discussion of the findings to consider how a federal race-conscious initiative can have a transformational impact on a campus. 
The findings reveal a college that struggled with institutional change through this process, while also grappling with the meaning of race and how it impacts service to AAPI student populations. The implications for this research are multifold, and touch practice, policy, research and methodology.  They ultimately point to a continued need for higher education to reconsider assumptions about AAPI students, and provide better service and support that acknowledges the needs of this population."

adolescent identity formation for teens in American Samoa? 2) What role could traditional 
Samoan dance play in forming a sense of self that merges two opposing cultural concepts of self? 
3) Can dance provide a venue for the semiotic representation of a merging of these construals of 
self?  While adolescence as a developmental period is not new to Samoa, teenagers in 
American Samoa are going through an adolescence that has become more similar to that 
experienced by American teens and less like the smooth and easy adolescence Mead described. 
Teens, according to Erik Erikson, are in a developmental period where they are asking 
themselves, “Who am I?” It is difficult to define self when one’s traditional culture emphasizes 
harmonious interdependence and playing one’s proper role in the hierarchy; meanwhile, the 
attractive, modern culture seen on television and in the movies emphasizes independence and 
individuality.  Not all teens were experiencing the kind of emotional turbulence that led others to selfdestructive "

This study of Willapa River Valley archaeology provides a context in which to interpret southern Northwest Coast near-coastal pre-contact archaeological sites. 
Three areas for investigation became evident during the initial research phase and directed subsequent inquiries.   The first dealt with prehistoric site distribution in the Willapa region landscape, the potential for locating sites, and site distribution patterns on the Willapa River Valley alluvial terraces.  Bayesian GIS modeling and geomorphologic-based survey techniques identified a new sample of 26 localities representing approximately 10,000 years of occupation.   Eustatic sea level rise, seismic movement, tsunamis, and fluvial processes formed the Willapa region's landscape, and promoted natural redox reaction formation processes within submerged archaeological contexts. 
The second involved the pre-contact utilization of lithic, floral, and faunal natural resources, and how these adaptations relate to what we know from past work at coastal-adjacent midden sites.  Excavation at the Forks Creek terrace site revealed a detailed chronology of a 2700 BP Willapa River Valley camp oriented toward the seasonal hazelnut, bitter cherry, elk, deer, and salmon resources of a fire-maintained prairie ""garden"" and the Willapa River.  Microblades were manufactured for their technological qualities, illustrating similarities to Salish Sea ""Locarno Beach"" assemblages. 
The third encompassed the archaeology of the Athabaskan Kwalhioqua, and addressed the potential for recognizing cultural enclaves in the archaeological record through the study of exotic obsidian and blueschist artifacts.  Obsidian ""wealth blades,"" blueschist clubs, and nephrite adze artifacts define a pattern of late prehistoric long-distance trade and exchange.  The ""Pacific Athabaskan coastal trade network"" hypothesis poses that direct sea-going canoe trade occurred between Athabaskan cultures of the southern Northwest Coast within a counter-seismic ceremonial dance network prior to the great earthquake of AD 1700. 
New insights into the prehistory of the Willapa River Valley are provided with consideration given to site location, age of occupation, cultural landscapes, and the position of the Willapa River Valley prehistoric occupation within the Pacific Northwest."

These coordinates are then processed through the interlocutor (in the case of this dissertation, the reader) who filters the data through the lenses of their positionality. This work necessarily recognizes that the interlocutors frames of reference are, like mine, shaped by their positionality. 
The three prime ethos/culture based epistemologies that are examined are the NDN (more commonly referenced as Native American), the United States Marine and the Academic. The analysis performed is done through my personal experiences,  as processed through a number of theoretical frames. While this limits the scope of the work to my interactions through and within the epistemology, it also recognizes that these epistemologies are keys to formulating identities that are living, moving, contradictory shifting concepts. 
I conclude that the various Ideological State Appartatuses (Althusser) and Panoptic policing or disciplining discourses/structures (Foucault) that shape and authenticate these three discourses of authenticity are both internally contradictory and mutually contradictory in ways that illuminate several hegemonic processes at play in the contemporary US and NDN country. While recognizing the inherent limits of an autoethnographic methodology, I believe I have elaborated an approach that can be widely used in examining not only these three but other identity-based communities."

Health disparities reach into every aspect of life and underlie many of the social, political, and environmental challenges facing indigenous populations around the world. While the specific manifestations of the social determinants of health are unique to specific tribes, and even families or clans within tribes, the etiology is not. Colonialism, and the resulting loss of lives, culture, identity, voice, and place is the base ingredient of a post-colonial trauma syndemic. This dissertation posits that the maintenance and restoration indigenous practices such as storytelling, and traditional tobacco use can reinforce connection to culture and cultural continuity which is a promising protective factor within the post-colonial trauma syndemic. However, in order to effectively address the post-colonial trauma syndemic, further investigation into protective factors must be initiated including an investigation into factors that can be introduced or reinforced as well as provide greater recognition of those that are already in place such resilient oral traditions and knowledge of pre-colonial practices. Finally, the potential contributions to this effort by anthropology are many. This dissertation presents one such contribution by offering an example of efforts to work collaboratively between interdisciplinary and ethnic communities towards the common goal of improving health."

During the Spanish Conquest the first law prohibiting peyote’s ceremonial use was introduced. Conflicts between colonial powers and indigenous peoples over the use of peyote have continued into the present; with peyote access and possession strictly regulated in the United States. While exemptions have been established for the religious use of peyote by Native Americans, U.S. laws on peyote remain clouded by misunderstanding and stark divides in notions of sacrament, religious practice, addiction, medicine, and general differences in worldview. Peyotism, the religious use of peyote, emerged among the Plains tribes during the mid to late-1800s and spread rapidly on the reservations where peyote came to be revered as a holy medicine, a symbol of resistance, and also helped to rebuild communities broken by ethnocide. Peyote continues to play an important role within various tribes as a religious sacrament, a medicinal treatment for addiction, spiritual maladies, and historical trauma, and as a source of indigenous confidence and pride. The legal status of peyote is a precarious one, one that is exacerbated by diminishing supplies of the cactus in the United States and by the appropriation and exploitation of Native American religious practices by non-Natives seeking legal protection to both use and profit from peyote. The relationship between people and peyote is complex and multifaceted, and this study attempts to examine the major cultural threads at the heart of this relationship, particularly the sacramental and medical use of peyote by Native Americans, its market exchange, and the various legal controls imposed on peyote, and tie them together in a comprehensive and pertinent manner."

My work focuses on the Okanagan (wqna=qin-x) homelands, specifically as part of North America, Canada and the US in the 49th parallel bi-national boundary, Northern borderland area divided between Canada and the US in the state of Washington and province of British Columbia.This website keeps in mind the two most interrelated generations in our communities: elders and youth by making them an integral part of my work processes as primary sources, molding my work by their voices. We cannot get at the heart of decolonizing without the involvement of the knowledge keepers, the elders, and the future, the youth. In this context, Manuhuia Barcham's notion of ""maintenance of prior identity"" focuses our attention on change, living culture, and generational transition. Barcham interrupts the static position of current western theories and praxis of Indigenous rights that do not represent living, changing Indigenous cultures, and identities. This website uses, the tools of technology to empower these living, changing, breathing cultures. I speak back to re-interrupt the ""vanishing primitive"" myth, ahistorical placement of Indigenous peoples and cultures in the past, and push for malleable interpretations of identity for Okanagan and mixed Indigenous people that are from a place, but also carry their indigeneities with them no matter where they are on earth."
