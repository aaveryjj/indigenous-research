For the purposes of this collection, Indigenous Studies research -- what is also referred to as Native American, American Indian, Native, or First Nations research -- is defined as work that centers Western Hemisphere Indigenous peoples, topics, issues, and events. This includes peoples indigenous to the modern-day countries of North and South America, who have called these lands home long before European settler-colonization. 
Indigenous knowledge, wisdom, and culture deserve to be valued and shared. For Indigenous communities and scholars, who have often been taken advantage of by non-Indigenous (mainly white) researchers, Open Access Indigenous research can begin to connect the benefits of research to the people themselves and contribute to cultural revitalization. For non-Indigenous researchers, appreciating Indigenous ways of knowing allows us to expand and critique our worldview and understanding of culture, heritage, history, and religion.

While Indigneous authorship was not a collection requirement, many of these works are written by Indigenous people and/or in connection with Indigneous tribes and communities. My hope is that this collection uplifts and centers Indigenous voices.
