## About the Collection
This collection represents student theses and dissertations on Indigenous people and subjects, collected from Open Access Institutional Repositories in the Pacific Northwest (Washington and Oregon). The goal of the collection is to promote the accessibility and visibility of Indigenous scholarship and data. 



### Data Collection
**Institutional Repositories**

The Universities represented here were chosen by first compiling a list of research institutions in Washington and Oregon that had digital institutional repositories with open access content. After a preliminary exploration of the repositories to estimate how many relevant works each contained, the universities were organized from high priority (over 100 Indigenous Studies works) to low priority (under 25) for robust data collection. This project is ongoing.


**Individual Works**

Indigneous work is often interdisciplinary, and often comes from scholars outside of Indigenous/Native American programs. Works were selected for inclusion based on literary warrant, or how the works self-identified: through keywords in the title, abstract, content, or subject tags. Author disclosure of Indigenous identity was not a collection requirement. Only student theses, dissertations, and field projects were chosen, due to the prevalence of these works within institutional repositories and for curation in the DTL's OCLC collections.

The metadata collected for each work was informed by the [Dublin Core Metadata Schema.](https://www.dublincore.org/about/) The fields include: objectid, title, creator, date, work type, discipline, subject, description, institution, location, description, filename, format, OCLC number, and record type. Metadata was hand-collected by Avery Johnson, along with assistance from Sierra Valadez and Javier Cordova in the course of their DTL internship.


**Project Information**

This digital collection was curated by Avery Johnson, graduate student at the University of Washington, as part of a Capstone project for the Library and Information Science program. As a white woman, I acknowledge that my understanding of these issues is limited by my privilege and lived experiences, and I am constantly striving to decolonize my practice and perspectives.

This project was sponsored by the [Open Access Digital Theological Library,](https://libguides.thedtl.org/oadtl/about) whose mission "is to curate high-quality content in religious studies and related disciplines from publisher websites, institutional repositories, scholarly societies, archives, and stable public domain collections." The vast majority of works included in this digital collection are cataloged in [OCLC,](https://www.oclc.org/en/worldcat.html) one of the largest integrated library systems in the world, and included in the DTL's OCLC collections.

The work for this project was undertaken on [Duwamish land.](https://www.duwamishtribe.org/), the home of the first people of Seattle. Acknowledging, honoring, and respecting the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded this land for generations is only the first step towards reconciliation, reparative justice, and resisting the erasure of Indigenous peoples, cultures, and heritage. For a more detailed look at the purpose and usefullness of land acknowledgements, I recommend this piece, [Revisiting "Beyond Territorial Acknowledgments"](https://apihtawikosisan.com/2024/11/revisiting-beyond-territorial-acknowledgments/) by Métis author âpihtawikosisân, Chelsea Vowel.

### Indigenous Studies
For the purposes of this collection, Indigenous Studies research -- what is also referred to as Native American, American Indian, Native, or First Nations research -- is defined as work that centers Western Hemisphere Indigenous peoples, topics, issues, and events. This includes peoples indigenous to the modern-day countries of North and South America, who have called these lands home long before European settler-colonization. 

For a list of Indigenous Studies / Native American Studies programs in the United States, visit the [Association on American Indian Affairs.](https://www.indian-affairs.org/nativestudies.html)



### Open Access
Open Access research is available without fees, restrictions, or institutional affiliation. This means anyone with an internet connection can read the full content of the work. The majority of academic publishers require readers and libraries to pay journal subscriptions to access their publications, which means that creating and sharing Open Access research helps level the playing field for scholars by removing financial barriers.
