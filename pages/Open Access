### What is Open Access?
Open Access research is research that is available without fees, restrictions, or institutional affiliation. This means anyone with an internet connection can read the full content of the work. The majority of academic publishers require readers and libraries to pay journal subscriptions to access their publications, which can be prohibit access. Creating and sharing Open Access research helps level the playing field for scholars by removing financial barriers. 
Of course, this can mean the costs of publishing are simply passed on to the writer, instead of the reader. And not all information or knowledge is meant to be accessible for everyone -- for example, many Indigenous tribes have knowledge that is only meant to be shared at certain times and with certain people.
It's not a perfect system! But spreading awareness of and support for Open Access can help to make this option easier for writers to pursue, and makes visible work that is already free.
